                    <h2>Variable Stars</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Stars whose brightness changes over time due to intrinsic physical processes or external factors, serving as crucial tools for measuring astronomical distances and understanding stellar evolution.

                    <div class="context">
                        Variable stars include several important types: Cepheid variables, which pulsate with periods directly related to their intrinsic brightness, making them excellent "standard candles" for distance measurements; RR Lyrae stars, used for measuring distances within our galaxy; and eclipsing binaries, where the brightness changes are caused by one star passing in front of another. Cepheid variables were crucial in Edwin Hubble's discovery of the expanding universe, as they allowed him to measure distances to nearby galaxies and establish that spiral nebulae were actually separate galaxies beyond the Milky Way.

                    <h2>Venus</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The second planet from the Sun, a terrestrial rocky planet that is the second brightest reflecting object in the solar system after the Moon, located about 0.7 AU from the Sun.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Venus is often called Earth's "twin" due to similar size and mass, but it's actually a hellish world with surface temperatures of 872Â°F (hot enough to melt lead), crushing atmospheric pressure of 93 bar, and an atmosphere that is 96% carbon dioxide. The planet experiences a runaway greenhouse effect that maintains constant temperatures day and night. Venus has no magnetic field to protect from solar wind, though auroral activity has been reported. The planet rotates clockwise (retrograde) with a day lasting about 117 Earth days, while its year is about 225 Earth days - meaning a Venusian year contains only about two Venusian days. Venus appears as either the "morning star" (called Phosphorus by Greeks, Lucifer by Romans) or "evening star" (called Hesperus by Greeks, Vesper by Romans) depending on its position relative to Earth and the Sun.

                    <h2>Venusian Cloud</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The thick cloud cover surrounding Venus, composed primarily of sulfur dioxide and microdroplets of sulfuric acid, with wind speeds reaching 220 mph at the cloud tops.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Venusian clouds create a perpetually overcast sky that blocks most sunlight from reaching the surface, resulting in only 5,000 to 10,000 lux of illumination compared to 100,000 lux on a bright Earth day. The clouds are highly reflective, making Venus the brightest planet in our sky, but they also trap heat through the greenhouse effect. Lightning occurs within these clouds, accompanying any descent to Venus's surface. The extreme wind speeds at cloud level (220 mph) contrast sharply with the gentle 2.5 mph surface winds. These clouds are part of what makes Venus such an inhospitable world, contributing to the crushing atmospheric pressure and extreme temperatures that would destroy any spacecraft attempting to land.

                    <div class="definition">
                        Two NASA missions (Viking 1 and 2) that successfully landed on Mars in 1976, conducting the first detailed study of the Martian surface and searching for signs of life.

                    <div class="context">
                        The Viking missions included biological experiments designed to detect microbial life in Martian soil. While the results were inconclusive and initially interpreted as negative, some scientists continue to debate whether the missions may have detected signs of life. The missions provided the first detailed images and data from the Martian surface, laying the groundwork for all subsequent Mars exploration.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The portion of the universe that we can observe, limited by the distance light has traveled since the Big Bang, approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter.

                    <div class="context">
                        The visible universe is larger than 13.8 billion light-years in radius because space itself has been expanding while light travels to us. Beyond this observable boundary, the universe may extend infinitely, but we cannot see it because light from those regions hasn't had time to reach us yet.
