# PWC Website Atmospheric Terms Addition Plan - Revision 102025

## New Terms to Add (5 total)

Based on PWCAdditions-Rev102025.odt and Module 5A source material:

### 1. Meteors (Meteoroids, Meteorites)
**Placement**: Just after Meteorology (M page)
**Source**: Space science, atmospheric entry phenomena
**Definition**: Space rocks in different phases - meteoroids in space, meteors burning in atmosphere, meteorites on ground
**Context**: Size ranges, atmospheric entry process, scientific classification, observation methods
**Links**: Wikipedia + NASA Solar System (direct definition source)

### 2. Methane  
**Placement**: Just before Microbursts (M page)
**Source**: Module 5A atmospheric chemistry, greenhouse gases
**Definition**: Colorless greenhouse gas with chemical formula CH4, significant atmospheric component
**Context**: Sources (natural and anthropogenic), greenhouse effect role, atmospheric chemistry, climate impact
**Links**: Wikipedia + EPA greenhouse gases (direct definition source)

### 3. Mount Pinatubo
**Placement**: Just before Multiverse (M page)
**Source**: Volcanic atmospheric impacts, climate effects
**Definition**: Philippine volcano whose 1991 eruption significantly impacted global climate and atmospheric composition
**Context**: 1991 eruption details, sulfur aerosol injection, global cooling effects, atmospheric science significance
**Links**: Wikipedia + USGS volcano observatory (direct information source)

### 4. Nacreous Clouds
**Placement**: First in letter N (N page)
**Source**: Polar stratospheric phenomena, Module 5A cloud types
**Definition**: Rare iridescent clouds forming in polar stratosphere, also known as polar stratospheric clouds
**Context**: Formation conditions, altitude (15-25 km), polar winter occurrence, ozone depletion role, visual characteristics
**Links**: Wikipedia + WMO Cloud Atlas (direct definition source)

### 5. Noctilucent Clouds
**Placement**: Just after Nitrogen (N page)
**Source**: Mesospheric phenomena, high-altitude clouds
**Definition**: Highest clouds in atmosphere, forming in mesosphere at 76-85 km altitude, visible during twilight
**Context**: Ice crystal composition, summer occurrence, mesospheric temperatures, visibility conditions, possible climate connections
**Links**: Wikipedia + NASA atmospheric research (direct definition source)

## Page Modifications Required

### M Page (pages/m.html)
Add 3 new entries with exact positioning:
- Meteors (Meteoroids, Meteorites) after Meteorology
- Methane before Microbursts  
- Mount Pinatubo before Multiverse

### N Page (pages/n.html)
Add 2 new entries with exact positioning:
- Nacreous Clouds as first entry
- Noctilucent Clouds after Nitrogen

## Alphabetization Requirements
Follow exact placement instructions with no approximations. Use "just after", "just before", and "first" positioning precisely. Maintain existing alphabetical order for all other entries. Ensure proper HTML structure and formatting.

## Content Standards
Each entry must have Wikipedia link. Additional relevant links only when they go directly to pages defining the term (no junk links). Definitions based on Module 5A source material and authoritative sources. Professional atmospheric science context. Consistent formatting with existing entries.

## Quality Assurance
Verify exact positioning for each new term. Check HTML syntax and structure. Ensure all links are functional and directly relevant to term definitions. Maintain website styling and navigation.
