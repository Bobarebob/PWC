                        Callisto is considered one of the most promising targets for astrobiology research due to its subsurface ocean, which may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. The moon's relatively stable environment and distance from Jupiter's intense radiation make it an attractive target for future exploration missions. Unlike Europa, Callisto's ocean is likely separated from its rocky core by a layer of ice, but it still represents a potentially habitable environment.

                        The candela is one of the seven SI base units and is fundamental to photometry - the measurement of light as perceived by the human eye. Unlike radiometric units that measure all electromagnetic radiation, photometric units like the candela are weighted according to human visual sensitivity. The definition is based on the luminosity function of the human eye, which peaks at green light (555 nm wavelength). One candela is approximately the luminous intensity of a common candle, which is how the unit got its name. The candela is used to define other photometric units including the lumen (luminous flux) and the lux (illuminance). Understanding luminous intensity is crucial for lighting design, display technology, and any application involving human vision and light perception.

                        Carbon dioxide is a key greenhouse gas that traps heat in Earth's atmosphere through the greenhouse effect. While it represents a small fraction of the atmosphere by volume, its concentration has increased by over 40% since pre-industrial times due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. CO₂ is essential for photosynthesis in plants and is part of the natural carbon cycle, but elevated levels contribute to global warming and climate change. The gas is also found in the atmosphere of Venus, where it creates extreme greenhouse effects. Atmospheric CO₂ levels are measured at observatories like Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and serve as a key indicator of climate change.

                        The Celsius scale, originally called centigrade, was developed by Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius in 1742. It is part of the metric system and is the standard temperature scale used in scientific research and weather reporting in most countries. The scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, making it intuitive for everyday use. In atmospheric science, Celsius is used to measure air temperature, dew point, and other thermal properties. The scale relates to the Kelvin scale (the SI base unit for temperature) by the simple conversion: °K = °C + 273.15.

The name centigrade literally means "hundred grades" or "hundred steps," reflecting the 100-degree span between water's freezing and boiling points. While the official name is now Celsius, the term centigrade is still occasionally used, particularly in older scientific literature and some informal contexts.

                        Chandrasekhar's most famous discovery was the theoretical limit for the mass of white dwarf stars, now known as the Chandrasekhar limit (approximately 1.44 solar masses). He showed that white dwarfs above this mass cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse, leading to either neutron stars or black holes. His work laid the foundation for understanding stellar evolution and the final stages of stellar life. Chandrasekhar was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with William Fowler, for his theoretical studies of the physical processes important to the structure and evolution of stars. The Chandra X-ray Observatory is named in his honor.

                        Named after Soviet physicist Pavel Cherenkov, this phenomenon occurs when charged particles (such as electrons or muons) exceed the local speed of light in a material medium like water or glass. While nothing can travel faster than light in a vacuum, light travels slower in dense media, allowing high-energy particles to exceed this reduced speed. The result is a shock wave of light, similar to a sonic boom but in the electromagnetic spectrum. Cherenkov radiation appears as a distinctive blue glow and is commonly observed in nuclear reactors, where it illuminates the water surrounding fuel rods. The intensity and angle of Cherenkov light are proportional to the particle's energy, making it useful for detecting and measuring high-energy particles in physics experiments. Cherenkov detectors are essential tools in particle physics, neutrino astronomy, and cosmic ray research.

Clouds are classified by altitude (high, middle, low) and appearance (cumulus, stratus, cirrus), with each type indicating different atmospheric conditions. In climate science, clouds represent one of the most complex feedback mechanisms - they can both cool the planet by reflecting sunlight and warm it by trapping heat. Cloud formation requires water vapor, condensation nuclei (tiny particles), and cooling mechanisms that bring air to saturation.

                    <div class="definition">
                        Light that exhibits both temporal and spatial coherence, meaning all light waves have the same frequency and are synchronized in phase, traveling in the same direction with minimal divergence.

                        Coherent light is fundamentally different from ordinary light sources like incandescent bulbs or the sun, which emit incoherent light with random phases and multiple frequencies. Laser light achieves coherence through stimulated emission, where photons trigger the emission of identical photons from excited atoms. Temporal coherence means all photons have the same frequency (monochromatic), while spatial coherence means all rays travel in the same direction with parallel wave fronts. This coherence gives laser light unique properties: it doesn't spread out significantly over distance, can be focused to extremely small spots, and maintains its intensity over long distances. These properties make coherent light essential for applications including fiber optic communications, precision measurements, medical procedures, industrial cutting, and scientific research. The degree of coherence determines the laser's effectiveness for different applications.

                        Color theory combines physics, psychology, and art to understand how humans perceive and respond to different wavelengths of visible light. The foundation is the electromagnetic spectrum, where different wavelengths (approximately 380-700 nanometers) are perceived as different colors. Primary colors (red, green, blue in additive systems; cyan, magenta, yellow in subtractive systems) cannot be created by mixing other colors. Secondary colors result from mixing primaries, while tertiary colors come from mixing primary and secondary colors. The color wheel organizes these relationships and helps predict how colors interact. Color temperature describes the warmth or coolness of light, measured in Kelvin. Understanding color theory is essential for lighting design, display technology, photography, art, and any field involving human visual perception. Modern applications include LED lighting systems, computer displays, and digital imaging.

In additive color systems (like computer monitors), complementary pairs include red-cyan, green-magenta, and blue-yellow. When these wavelengths are combined, they stimulate all three types of cone cells in the human eye equally, producing the perception of white light. In subtractive color systems (like paints), complementary colors absorb each other's wavelengths, theoretically producing black. The high contrast between complementary colors makes them vibrant when placed adjacent to each other, a phenomenon called simultaneous contrast. This principle is used in art, design, photography, and digital displays to create visual impact and balance. Understanding complementary colors is essential for color correction in photography, creating effective visual designs, and optimizing display technologies for human vision.

                        Condensation is a fundamental process in the water cycle and atmospheric science, responsible for cloud formation, precipitation, and dew formation. It occurs when air containing water vapor is cooled to its saturation point, either through radiative cooling, adiabatic expansion during rising motion, or contact with cooler surfaces. The process requires condensation nuclei - tiny particles such as dust, sand, or bacteria - around which water droplets can form. Condensation releases latent heat, which can fuel further atmospheric processes like thunderstorm development. Understanding condensation is essential for weather prediction and climate modeling.

                    <div class="context">
                        The human eye contains three types of cone cells, each sensitive to different portions of the visible light spectrum: S-cones (short wavelength, ~420-440nm, perceived as blue), M-cones (medium wavelength, ~530-540nm, perceived as green), and L-cones (long wavelength, ~560-580nm, perceived as red). These cone cells work together through opponent processing in the brain to create our perception of the full color spectrum. Cones are concentrated in the fovea, the central region of the retina, providing sharp central vision and color discrimination. Unlike rod cells that function in low light, cones require bright light to operate effectively, which is why color vision diminishes in dim conditions. Color blindness results from genetic variations in cone cell photopigments, most commonly affecting the ability to distinguish red and green wavelengths. Understanding cone cell function is essential for display technology, lighting design, and vision science.

These cells occur at various scales, from small thermal updrafts that create cumulus clouds to large-scale Hadley cells that drive global circulation patterns. In the tropics, Hadley cells transport heat from the equator toward the poles, while smaller convection cells are responsible for thunderstorm development and local weather patterns. Understanding convection cells is essential for weather prediction and climate modeling.

                        The Coriolis effect is fundamental to understanding atmospheric circulation, ocean currents, and weather patterns. It causes moving air masses to curve rather than travel in straight lines, leading to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones. In the Northern Hemisphere, low-pressure systems rotate counterclockwise while high-pressure systems rotate clockwise, with the opposite occurring in the Southern Hemisphere. The effect is strongest at the poles and weakest at the equator, where it becomes zero. The Coriolis effect is responsible for the trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies that drive global atmospheric circulation patterns. It also influences ocean currents and is crucial for understanding large-scale weather systems like hurricanes and typhoons.

                        Cosmic inflation lasted less than a trillionth of a second but expanded the observable universe by about 26 orders of magnitude - from the size of a proton to the size of a grapefruit. This process explains the remarkable uniformity of the cosmic microwave background. Inflation theory explains several key features of our universe, including its flatness, uniformity, and the origin of the density fluctuations that eventually became galaxies and stars.

                        The CMB was released during the recombination epoch when the universe cooled enough for electrons and protons to form neutral hydrogen atoms, making the universe transparent to light for the first time. Originally at 3000 Kelvin, this radiation has been redshifted to 2.73 Kelvin today. The CMB provides crucial evidence for the Big Bang theory and allows scientists to study the early universe's conditions and composition with extraordinary precision.

                        Einstein initially added the cosmological constant (Λ) to his equations to prevent the universe from expanding or contracting. After Hubble's discovery of cosmic expansion, Einstein called it his "greatest mistake." However, the discovery of accelerating expansion has revived interest in this concept. The cosmological constant is now the leading explanation for dark energy, the mysterious force driving the universe's accelerating expansion.

                        As the universe expands, the space between galaxies stretches, and light traveling through this space gets stretched as well. This is different from Doppler redshift, which is caused by motion through space rather than the expansion of space itself. Cosmological redshift is a key tool for measuring distances to far galaxies and studying the expansion history of the universe.

After this point, dark energy became the dominant force, causing the expansion to accelerate. This transition fundamentally changed the universe's fate from potential collapse to eternal expansion.

                        Cumulonimbus clouds are the most dramatic and powerful cloud type, often called "thunderheads" due to their association with thunderstorms. They form through strong convective processes when warm, moist air rises rapidly through the atmosphere, creating towering structures that can reach heights of 12-18 km (40,000-60,000 feet). The characteristic anvil shape at the top forms when the rising air hits the tropopause and spreads horizontally. These clouds produce lightning, thunder, heavy precipitation, hail, tornadoes, and strong winds. They are classified as vertical development clouds and represent some of the most energetic atmospheric phenomena, with updrafts that can exceed 30 m/s (100 ft/s).
