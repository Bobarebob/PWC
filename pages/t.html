                        Tardigrades are considered extremophiles and have been used in astrobiology research to understand the limits of life's survival. Their remarkable resilience has implications for the possibility of life surviving interplanetary travel and existing in harsh extraterrestrial environments. They can enter a state called cryptobiosis, essentially suspending all biological processes until conditions improve.

                        Technosignatures represent a modern approach to SETI that goes beyond radio signals to include any detectable signs of technology. Examples might include industrial pollutants in exoplanet atmospheres, artificial lighting on the night side of planets, or large-scale engineering projects like Dyson spheres. This broader approach increases the chances of detecting advanced civilizations.

                        A measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. In astronomy, we associate temperature with anything that is incandescent or glowing.

                        Temperature is fundamental to understanding stellar physics and cosmology. Hotter glowing objects emit light with higher dominant frequencies and appear bluer, while cooler objects appear redder. This relationship is described by Wien's Displacement Law, which states that the dominant wavelength of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature. In astronomy, stars of the highest surface temperature glow blue, while stars of the lowest surface temperature glow red or brown.

The CMB light was initially in the visible portion of the spectrum (yellowish orange) but has been redshifted to microwave frequencies as the Universe expanded and the light wavelengths stretched. This cooling will continue as the Universe expands, eventually leading to the Big Chill scenario.

                        A hypothetical Mars-sized planetesimal that is believed to have collided with the early Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, leading to the formation of the Moon.

                        The Giant Impact Hypothesis proposes that Theia struck the early Earth with a glancing blow, vaporizing both Theia and a chunk of Earth. The debris from this collision formed a ring around Earth that eventually coalesced into the Moon. This theory explains many characteristics of the Earth-Moon system, including the Moon's relatively large size compared to Earth, the similar composition of Earth and lunar rocks, and the high angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. The collision would have been catastrophic, likely melting the entire surface of Earth and ejecting massive amounts of material into space. Evidence for this theory comes from the isotopic similarities between Earth and Moon rocks, as well as computer simulations of planetary formation.

                        The thermosphere is where temperatures can reach 1,500°C (2,700°F) or higher, though the air is so thin that it would not feel hot to a human. This layer contains the ionosphere, where solar radiation ionizes gas molecules, creating charged particles that enable radio communication and cause the aurora. The International Space Station orbits in the lower thermosphere, where it experiences atmospheric drag that gradually lowers its orbit. The thermosphere expands and contracts significantly with solar activity - during solar maximum, increased solar radiation heats this layer and causes it to expand, increasing atmospheric drag on satellites. Despite the high temperatures, the extremely low density means there are very few molecules to transfer heat, so spacecraft in this region require thermal protection from solar radiation rather than atmospheric heating.

                        A gravitational phenomenon where an orbiting body always shows the same face to the object it orbits, occurring when the orbital period equals the rotational period.

                        The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which is why we always see the same side (the near side) from Earth. This synchronization developed over billions of years due to tidal forces between Earth and the Moon. The Moon's rotation period (sidereal day) and its orbital period around Earth (sidereal month) are both exactly 27.25 days. Tidal locking is common in the solar system - most large moons are tidally locked to their planets, and many binary star systems are tidally locked to each other. The process involves the gradual transfer of rotational energy through tidal friction, eventually resulting in synchronous rotation.

The tolerance and best guess should have the same number of digits to the right of the decimal point, reflecting consistent precision levels.

                        A rare astronomical event where Venus passes directly between Earth and the Sun, appearing as a small black dot crossing the Sun's face, occurring in pairs separated by about 8 years with over a century between pairs.

                        Transits of Venus were historically crucial for determining the scale of the solar system by measuring the astronomical unit. The most recent transits occurred in 2004 and 2012, with the next pair not occurring until 2117 and 2125. These events provided early astronomers with a method to calculate the distance to the Sun using parallax measurements from different locations on Earth. The transit method is now used extensively to detect exoplanets, as planets orbiting other stars cause similar but much smaller dimming effects when they pass in front of their host stars.

                        Trivial systematic errors are the most common and manageable type of systematic error in scientific measurements. Examples include zero calibration error (when an instrument doesn't read zero when it should), or parallax (eyeball) error (when you look at an analog measuring device off to one side, instead of straight on). These errors can typically be corrected by using proper measurement technique. Unlike non-trivial systematic errors, trivial systematic errors are predictable and easily remedied. For instance, if a digital caliper consistently reads 0.02 mm when its jaws are closed, this trivial zero error can be corrected by pressing the device's tare button, when its jaws are closed.

This imaginary line passes through several countries including Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, and southern China. The angle of 23.5° corresponds to Earth's axial tilt, which is responsible for our planet's seasons.

                        The troposphere contains about 75% of the atmosphere's mass and nearly all of its water vapor, making it the layer where clouds, precipitation, and Earth-based weather systems develop. Temperature typically decreases with altitude at a rate of about 6.5°C per kilometer (the environmental lapse rate), though this can vary with local conditions. The top of the troposphere is called the tropopause, which acts as a boundary that limits vertical mixing with the stratosphere above. The troposphere is thickest at the equator and thinnest at the poles due to thermal expansion from solar heating. This layer is crucial for life on Earth as it contains the oxygen we breathe and provides the atmospheric pressure necessary for liquid water to exist. All commercial aviation occurs below 43,000 feet in the troposphere.

                        There are three types of twilight based on the Sun's position below the horizon: civil twilight (Sun 0-6° below horizon), nautical twilight (Sun 6-12° below horizon), and astronomical twilight (Sun 12-18° below horizon). Civil twilight provides enough light for most outdoor activities without artificial lighting. Nautical twilight is when the horizon is still visible at sea for navigation. Astronomical twilight ends when the sky becomes completely dark for astronomical observations. The duration of twilight varies with latitude and season, being longest near the poles and during summer months.

                        A specific type of stellar explosion that occurs when a white dwarf star accumulates matter from a companion star and reaches a critical mass, causing a thermonuclear explosion with remarkably consistent peak brightness.

                        Type Ia supernovae are crucial "standard candles" for measuring cosmic distances because they all reach approximately the same peak luminosity. By comparing their apparent brightness to their known intrinsic brightness, astronomers can calculate their distance. These supernovae were the key tool used to discover the accelerating expansion of the universe and the existence of dark energy, revolutionizing our understanding of cosmology.
