## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Implement alphabetization corrections first
   - Move Dark Matter and Deimos and Phobos to correct positions
   - Verify existing alphabetical order maintained

2. **Phase 2**: Add new terms with exact positioning
   - Follow "first", "immediately after", "immediately before" specifications
   - Maintain consistent HTML structure and formatting

3. **Phase 3**: Quality assurance
   - Verify all positioning requirements met
   - Check HTML syntax and functionality
   - Ensure all links are relevant and functional

## Content Standards

- Each entry must have Wikipedia link
- Additional relevant links only when they directly define the term
- No junk or generic links
- Definitions based on Module 6A and authoritative sources
- Professional scientific context and explanations
- Consistent formatting with existing entries

## Quality Assurance Checklist

- [ ] Exact positioning verified for each new term
- [ ] Alphabetization corrections completed accurately
- [ ] HTML syntax validated
