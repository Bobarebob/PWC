                    <div class="definition">
                        American aviation pioneer (1897-1937) who was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and mysteriously disappeared while attempting to circumnavigate the globe.

                        Amelia Mary Earhart became an international icon for her aviation achievements and advocacy for women's rights. She set numerous aviation records, including being the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932. Her disappearance on July 2, 1937, during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe near Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean, remains one of aviation's greatest mysteries. Earhart's legacy continues to inspire generations of aviators and serves as a symbol of courage, determination, and the pursuit of scientific and technological advancement.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The average distance between the centers of Earth and the Moon, approximately 239,000 miles (384,400 kilometers), regularly measured using laser ranging to reflectors placed on the lunar surface.

                    <div class="context">
                        The Earth-Moon distance is precisely measured by shining laser beams off retroreflectors placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts and Soviet rovers. This distance varies due to the Moon's elliptical orbit, ranging from about 225,700 miles (perigee) to 252,000 miles (apogee). The Moon is gradually moving away from Earth at about 3.8 centimeters per year due to tidal forces. When the Moon first formed about 4.5 billion years ago, it was much closer to Earth - probably only about 24,000 miles away, or about 10 times closer than today. This distance is often used as a reference for other astronomical measurements within our solar system.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The complete range of electromagnetic radiation organized by frequency and wavelength, extending from radio waves with the longest wavelengths to gamma rays with the shortest wavelengths.

                    <div class="context">
                        The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all forms of electromagnetic radiation, which are fundamentally the same phenomenon - oscillating electric and magnetic fields traveling at the speed of light. The spectrum is typically divided into regions: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. Visible light occupies only a tiny portion of the spectrum, roughly 380-700 nanometers in wavelength. Each region has distinct properties and applications: radio waves for communication, microwaves for cooking and radar, infrared for thermal imaging, ultraviolet for sterilization, X-rays for medical imaging, and gamma rays for cancer treatment. The energy of electromagnetic radiation increases with frequency, making gamma rays the most energetic and radio waves the least energetic. Understanding the electromagnetic spectrum is fundamental to astronomy, communications, medicine, and many other fields.

The Cassini spacecraft discovered that the moon's south polar region has active geysers containing water, salts, and organic molecules, suggesting a warm, potentially habitable ocean beneath its icy surface. The tidal heating from Saturn keeps this ocean liquid.

                        Equilibrioception is an example of how we learn about the external world through sensory data, as described by Aristotle's principle that "knowledge is the product of experience." This sense works in conjunction with the vestibular system in our inner ear to help us maintain balance and spatial orientation. While we commonly think of only five senses (seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, tasting), humans actually have many more senses including equilibrioception, as well as senses of itching, hunger, and relative humidity.

                        The process by which liquid water changes to water vapor at temperatures below the boiling point, occurring when molecules at the surface gain enough energy to escape into the atmosphere.

                    <div class="context">
                        Evaporation is a crucial component of the water cycle and plays a fundamental role in atmospheric processes and weather patterns. Unlike boiling, which occurs throughout a liquid at a specific temperature, evaporation happens only at the surface and can occur at any temperature above freezing. The rate of evaporation depends on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and surface area. In the atmosphere, evaporation from oceans, lakes, rivers, and soil provides the water vapor that forms clouds and precipitation. The process also has a cooling effect, which is why sweating helps regulate body temperature and why wet surfaces feel cool. Evaporation is essential for the global energy balance, as it transfers latent heat from the surface to the atmosphere.

This groundbreaking achievement required precise coordination of telescopes around the world, using a technique called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The project later captured the first image of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. These images provided the first direct visual evidence of black holes and confirmed predictions of Einstein's general theory of relativity.
