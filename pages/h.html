                    <h2>Hail (Hailstones)</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Balls or lumps of ice that form in thunderstorm updrafts when raindrops are carried upward into freezing regions of the atmosphere and accumulate layers of ice before falling to the ground.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Hail formation requires strong thunderstorms with powerful updrafts that can carry water droplets above freezing altitudes multiple times. As the droplets are repeatedly lifted and frozen, they accumulate concentric layers of ice, growing larger with each cycle. The size of hailstones depends on the strength and duration of the updrafts - stronger storms can produce larger hail. Hailstones can range from pea-sized (5mm) to softball-sized (10cm) or larger in extreme cases. The largest recorded hailstone in the United States was 8 inches in diameter. Hail is most common in "Hail Alley," a region of the central United States where atmospheric conditions frequently favor severe thunderstorm development. Hail can cause significant damage to crops, vehicles, and buildings.

                    <h2>Hawking Radiation</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Theoretical radiation predicted to be emitted by black holes due to quantum effects near the event horizon, causing black holes to slowly evaporate over time.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974, this radiation arises from quantum fluctuations in the vacuum near a black hole's event horizon. Virtual particle pairs are created, with one particle falling into the black hole while the other escapes as radiation. Hawking radiation suggests that black holes are not completely black and will eventually evaporate completely, playing a crucial role in the universe's ultimate fate during the Big Chill scenario.

                    <h2>Heliocentric Model of the Solar System</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The model proposed by Copernicus stating that the Sun is at the center of the solar system, with planets orbiting around it.

                    <div class="context">
                        The heliocentric model provides a much simpler explanation for planetary retrograde motion compared to the geocentric model. In this model, planets closer to the Sun orbit faster (corresponding to Kepler's Third Law), and when Earth passes Mars "on the inside track," it creates the illusion of retrograde motion against the background stars. This model is the correct representation of our solar system and demonstrates Occam's Principle - the simpler of two competing hypotheses is likely to be correct. The apparent complexity of planetary motion is simply due to our perspective from Earth.

                    <h2>Edwin Hubble</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        American astronomer who discovered that the universe is expanding and established the relationship between galaxy distance and recession velocity, now known as Hubble's Law.

                    <div class="context">
                        In the 1920s, Hubble used the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory to measure distances to galaxies and their redshifts. He found that more distant galaxies are receding faster, providing the first observational evidence for cosmic expansion. Hubble's discoveries revolutionized cosmology, providing evidence for the Big Bang theory and establishing the field of extragalactic astronomy. The Hubble Space Telescope is named in his honor.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A scientifically vetted, tentative explanation of a physical phenomenon that needs to be proven (and repeatedly re-proven) by a well-designed experiment.

                    <div class="context">
                        When first doing an experiment, you assert a tentative (as yet unproven) idea that requires experimental verification. It is generally advisable not to test hypotheses that contradict already well-established scientific truths. When an hypothesis is conclusively proven by experiment, it becomes a scientific theory or fact. A scientific theory of general applicability is called a physical law or physical principle. The scientific method requires that hypotheses be testable and falsifiable.
