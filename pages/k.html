                    <div class="definition">
                        German astronomer and mathematician (1571-1630) who discovered the three fundamental laws of planetary motion, revolutionizing our understanding of the solar system.

                    <div class="context">
                        Kepler's three laws of planetary motion provided the mathematical foundation for understanding how planets orbit the Sun. His first law established that planetary orbits are elliptical rather than circular, his second law described how planets move faster when closer to the Sun, and his third law related orbital periods to distances from the Sun. These discoveries were crucial for Newton's later development of the law of universal gravitation and represent one of the greatest achievements in the history of astronomy and physics.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A NASA space telescope mission (2009-2018) designed to discover Earth-sized exoplanets in the habitable zones of their stars using the transit method.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The Kepler mission revolutionized exoplanet science by discovering over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets and thousands of candidates. Its data suggests that Earth-sized planets in habitable zones may be common throughout the galaxy, supporting the possibility of widespread life. The mission used the transit method, detecting the slight dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them.

                    <h2>Kepler's Third Law</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The law stating that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the Sun, mathematically expressed as T² ∝ a³.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Kepler's Third Law reveals the fundamental relationship between orbital distance and orbital period for all objects orbiting the Sun. This law allows astronomers to calculate orbital periods if they know distances, or vice versa. For example, Mars orbits at 1.5 AU from the Sun, so its orbital period should be (1.5)^(3/2) = 1.84 Earth years, which matches observations. This law was later explained by Newton's law of universal gravitation and applies to any system of orbiting bodies, from moons around planets to planets around stars.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A mass extinction event that occurred approximately 66 million years ago, marking the end of the Cretaceous period and the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Also known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, this catastrophe was likely caused by an asteroid impact combined with volcanic activity. The extinction of dinosaurs allowed mammals to diversify and eventually led to the evolution of humans, making it a crucial event in Earth's history and the Rare Earth Hypothesis. Without this event, intelligent life might never have evolved on Earth.
