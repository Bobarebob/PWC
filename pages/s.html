                    <h2>Brian Schmidt</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Australian-American astrophysicist and Nobel Prize laureate who co-discovered the accelerating expansion of the universe through observations of distant supernovae.

                    <div class="context">
                        As leader of the High-Z Supernova Search Team, Schmidt worked alongside Adam Riess and competed with Saul Perlmutter's team to measure the universe's expansion rate using Type Ia supernovae as standard candles. Schmidt shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering that the universe's expansion is accelerating, fundamentally changing our understanding of cosmology and leading to the concept of dark energy.

                    <h2>Second Law of Thermodynamics</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A fundamental principle of physics stating that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time, and that energy spontaneously flows from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        This law is crucial in astrobiology for understanding how life maintains order and complexity in a universe trending toward disorder. Living organisms create local decreases in entropy by consuming energy, which is consistent with the Second Law when considering the system as a whole. The law helps explain why life requires a continuous input of energy to maintain its organized state.

                        The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, a scientific effort to detect signs of intelligent life beyond Earth through various methods including radio signal detection and optical searches.

                    <div class="context">
                        SETI research began in earnest in the 1960s with Frank Drake's Project Ozma and continues today through organizations like the SETI Institute. Modern SETI uses advanced radio telescopes and signal processing techniques to search for artificial signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. The field has expanded to include searches for technosignatures and optical signals.

                    <h2>Vesto Slipher</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        American astronomer who first discovered that distant galaxies are redshifted, providing the initial observational evidence for the expansion of the universe before Edwin Hubble's more famous work.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Working at Lowell Observatory in the 1910s and 1920s, Slipher measured the spectra of spiral nebulae (now known to be galaxies) and found that most were redshifted, indicating they were moving away from Earth. Slipher's redshift measurements provided the crucial observational foundation for Hubble's later discovery of the expanding universe and the formulation of Hubble's Law.
