                    <div class="definition">
                        A temperature scale where water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees under standard atmospheric pressure, primarily used in the United States.

                    <div class="context">
                        The Fahrenheit scale was developed by German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1724. It was originally based on three reference points: the temperature of a mixture of ice, water, and salt (0°F), the freezing point of water (32°F), and human body temperature (originally 96°F, later adjusted to 98.6°F). While most of the world uses Celsius for scientific and everyday temperature measurements, Fahrenheit remains the standard in the United States for weather reporting and everyday use. The conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius is: °F = 9/5(°C) + 32. In atmospheric science, Fahrenheit is sometimes used in American meteorological reports, though Celsius is preferred for scientific research.

On this day, the Sun crosses the celestial equator moving southward, resulting in approximately equal hours of daylight and darkness worldwide. This day marks the transition from summer to autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and from winter to spring in the Southern Hemisphere.

                        The Fall or Autumnal Equinox occurs around September 22-23 each year and marks the official beginning of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and spring in the Southern Hemisphere. During the equinox, the Sun rises due east and sets due west everywhere on Earth. The word "equinox" comes from Latin meaning "equal night," referring to the nearly equal duration of day and night. This event is one of only two times per year when the Earth's axis is tilted neither toward nor away from the Sun.

                    <h2>Faraday's Law</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A fundamental law of electromagnetism stating that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, forming the basis for electromagnetic induction and the generation of electric current.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831, this law explains how electric generators, transformers, and inductors work. When a magnetic field through a conducting loop changes, it induces an electromotive force (EMF) that drives current through the circuit. The magnitude of the induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux. Faraday's law is one of Maxwell's four fundamental equations that describe electromagnetic phenomena and predict the existence of electromagnetic waves. This principle enables the conversion between mechanical energy and electrical energy, making possible electric power generation in power plants, whether they use steam turbines, hydroelectric dams, or wind turbines. The law also explains how electric motors work in reverse - changing electric fields can create mechanical motion.

                        The hemisphere of the Moon that is permanently turned away from Earth due to tidal locking, often incorrectly called the "dark side" of the Moon.

                    <div class="context">
                        The far side of the Moon is not permanently dark - it receives sunlight just like the near side, but we cannot see it from Earth because the Moon is tidally locked to our planet. The Moon rotates on its axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit Earth (about 27.3 days), so the same side always faces us. The far side was first photographed by the Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft in 1959 and first visited by humans during the Apollo 8 mission in 1968. It has a different appearance from the near side, with more craters and fewer large dark plains (maria), likely because it lacks the gravitational influence of Earth that helped create the smoother near side features.

                        Fiber optic telecommunications revolutionized global communications by exploiting the principle of total internal reflection to guide light through optical fibers with minimal loss. Light signals can travel through these fibers for many kilometers without significant degradation, making them ideal for internet backbone connections, telephone networks, and cable television. The technology uses different wavelengths of light (typically infrared) to carry multiple signals simultaneously through a single fiber, dramatically increasing data capacity. Fiber optics offer several advantages over traditional copper wires: immunity to electromagnetic interference, higher bandwidth, longer transmission distances, and enhanced security since the signals are difficult to intercept. Modern fiber optic systems can transmit terabits of data per second, enabling the high-speed internet and global communications networks that connect the modern world.

                        The motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone, with no other forces acting upon it, resulting in a constant acceleration of approximately 9.8 meters per second squared toward Earth's center.

                        Free fall occurs when an object is subject only to the force of gravity, with air resistance and other forces negligible or absent. All objects in free fall near Earth's surface accelerate at the same rate regardless of their mass, a principle first demonstrated by Galileo Galilei. This acceleration, known as gravitational acceleration (g), varies slightly with location but averages 9.8 m/s² or 32 ft/s². In a vacuum, a feather and a hammer would fall at the same rate, as famously demonstrated by Apollo 15 astronaut David Scott on the Moon. Free fall is fundamental to understanding projectile motion, orbital mechanics, and Einstein's principle of equivalence. The concept is crucial for physics education and has practical applications in engineering, sports, and space exploration.
