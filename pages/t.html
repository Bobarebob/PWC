                    <div class="definition">
                        Microscopic animals, also known as water bears, that are renowned for their ability to survive extreme conditions including radiation, dehydration, and the vacuum of space.

                        Tardigrades are considered extremophiles and have been used in astrobiology research to understand the limits of life's survival. Their remarkable resilience has implications for the possibility of life surviving interplanetary travel and existing in harsh extraterrestrial environments. They can enter a state called cryptobiosis, essentially suspending all biological processes until conditions improve.

                    <div class="definition">
                        Observable manifestations of technology that could indicate the presence of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, such as artificial radio signals, atmospheric pollution, or megastructures.

                    <div class="context">
                        Technosignatures represent a modern approach to SETI that goes beyond radio signals to include any detectable signs of technology. Examples might include industrial pollutants in exoplanet atmospheres, artificial lighting on the night side of planets, or large-scale engineering projects like Dyson spheres. This broader approach increases the chances of detecting advanced civilizations.

                    <h2>Type 1a Supernova</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A specific type of stellar explosion that occurs when a white dwarf star accumulates matter from a companion star and reaches a critical mass, causing a thermonuclear explosion with remarkably consistent peak brightness.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Type Ia supernovae are crucial "standard candles" for measuring cosmic distances because they all reach approximately the same peak luminosity. By comparing their apparent brightness to their known intrinsic brightness, astronomers can calculate their distance. These supernovae were the key tool used to discover the accelerating expansion of the universe and the existence of dark energy, revolutionizing our understanding of cosmology.
