                    <div class="definition">
                        Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects - a proposed form of dark matter consisting of ordinary matter that is simply too dim to detect directly, such as brown dwarfs, black holes, or rogue planets.

                        MACHOs represent one of two main candidates for dark matter (the other being WIMPs). These objects would be composed of baryonic matter but would be difficult to observe because they emit little or no light. While some MACHOs certainly exist, observations suggest they cannot account for all of the dark matter in the universe, leading to greater focus on exotic particle candidates like WIMPs.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The phenomenon where liquid creeps up the inside wall of a cylindrical glass tube, creating a curved surface that makes measurement challenging.

                    <div class="context">
                        In graduated cylinders, water creates a sort of half "U" shape due to the meniscus effect. This complicates liquid volume measurements because you must decide whether to read from the top or bottom of the meniscus. When using the top of the meniscus and viewing the water level straight on (at water level height to avoid parallax), you can actually see 5 parts in the least count, achieving better precision than the simple 50% rule would suggest.

                    <h2>Metric Metal Ruler</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        An analog measuring device marked off in millimeters, with a least count of 1 mm and tolerance of 0.5 mm following the one-half rule.

                    <div class="context">
                        For rulers marked in millimeters, scientific measurements follow a specific pattern: 13.0 ± 0.5 mm, 13.5 ± 0.5 mm, or 14.0 ± 0.5 mm. Notice that for a ruler marked in millimeters, the last digit for both the best guess and tolerance can only be 0 or 5, reflecting the precision limitations of the instrument. This demonstrates how the measuring device determines the format of the scientific measurement.

                    <h2>Micrometer Caliper</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        An analog measuring device, often called a micrometer or "mic," that works like a "glorified screw" attached to a ruler for precise measurements.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The micrometer works by turning the thimble counterclockwise, causing the spindle to move away from the fixed anvil. One complete rotation advances the spindle exactly 0.50 mm, with the least count being 0.01 mm. For analog devices like micrometers, the "one-half rule" is used - the tolerance is half of the least count (0.005 mm). Measurements are written as 15.500 ± 0.005 mm, demonstrating the high precision achievable with this instrument.

                        Microwave radiation is crucial in astronomy, particularly the cosmic microwave background (CMB) which is the afterglow of the Big Bang. This radiation provides a snapshot of the universe when it was only 380,000 years old and has been redshifted from visible light to microwave frequencies due to cosmic expansion.

                        The Milky Way is the focus of most SETI searches and astrobiology research, as it represents our local galactic environment. Understanding the structure and composition of our galaxy is crucial for estimating the potential number of habitable worlds and the likelihood of extraterrestrial civilizations. Recent studies suggest there could be billions of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy alone.

                        The hypothetical concept that our universe is just one of many universes, possibly infinite in number, each with potentially different physical laws and constants.

                    <div class="context">
                        The multiverse concept arose from attempts to explain why the fundamental constants of our universe appear to be fine-tuned for life. If infinite universes exist with different constants, we naturally find ourselves in one suitable for life. While the multiverse remains highly speculative and untestable, it offers a potential explanation for the apparent fine-tuning of physical constants without requiring divine intervention or special design.
