                        Ordinary matter composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons - the familiar matter that makes up stars, planets, and living beings.

                        Baryonic matter represents only about 4.6% of the total universe. The term "baryonic" comes from baryons, a class of particles that includes protons and neutrons. This is the matter we can see and interact with directly. Despite being the foundation of all visible structures in the universe, baryonic matter is vastly outnumbered by dark matter and dark energy, highlighting how little we understand about the universe's true composition.

                        Beam balance scales are less precise than micrometers, so they typically use the 100% rule for determining tolerance - meaning the tolerance equals the least count. For a typical beam balance scale with a least count of 0.1 grams, the tolerance is also 0.1 gram, so a measurement might be written as 45.3 ± 0.1 grams. These scales work by comparing the mass of an unknown object to known standard masses.

                        In a scientific measurement like 12.34 ± 0.02 cm, the best guess or best estimate is 12.34. This represents our single best estimate of the true value. When making many identical measurements (on the order of 100 measurements), statistics may allow us to produce a better best guess, typically the arithmetic average of all measurements. The best guess is always accompanied by a tolerance and unit to form a complete scientific measurement.

                        The Big Bang theory explains how the universe evolved from a hot, dense initial state to its current form. Evidence includes the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of light elements, and the observed expansion of the universe. The theory was first proposed by Georges Lemaître and later developed by many scientists.

                        The predicted ultimate fate of the universe, where continued accelerating expansion leads to a cold, dark, and empty cosmos with no remaining free sources of energy.

                        With dark energy driving accelerated expansion, the universe will continue to expand and cool indefinitely. Stars will burn out, black holes will evaporate through Hawking radiation, and the universe will reach maximum entropy. This scenario, also called the "Heat Death" of the universe, is estimated to occur in about 100 trillion years - more than 7,000 times longer than the current age of the universe.

                        A hypothetical scenario where the universe's expansion would eventually stop and reverse, causing all matter and energy to collapse back into a functional singularity - essentially the Big Bang in reverse.

                        Before the discovery of dark energy and accelerating expansion, some cosmologists theorized that if the universe contained enough matter, gravity would eventually overcome expansion and cause a contraction phase. The discovery of dark energy in 1998 made the Big Crunch scenario highly unlikely, as the accelerating expansion appears to be permanent.

The precise value of this constant appears to be fine-tuned to allow the formation of stars, planets, and life. If Big G were significantly different, the universe might not have developed the structures necessary for life to emerge.

He is now recognized as a martyr for scientific thought and free inquiry, and his ideas about multiple worlds have proven remarkably prescient.
