                    <h2>Index of Refraction</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A dimensionless number that describes how light propagates through a medium, defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in the medium.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The index of refraction (n) determines how much light bends when entering a material from another medium, following Snell's law: n₁sin(θ₁) = n₂sin(θ₂). Air has an index very close to 1.0, water has an index of about 1.33, and glass typically ranges from 1.5 to 1.9 depending on composition. Materials with higher refractive indices bend light more dramatically. The index of refraction varies with wavelength (causing dispersion), which is why prisms separate white light into colors. This wavelength dependence also causes chromatic aberration in lenses. Understanding refractive indices is essential for designing optical instruments, corrective lenses, fiber optics, and any system involving light transmission through materials. The index also relates to the material's optical density and affects phenomena like total internal reflection, which enables fiber optic communications.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A type of thinking where while we cannot say with 100% certainty that the next time you let go of a pen it will fall straight down, you would not bet your life that it won't happen, even for a million dollars.

                        Inductive reasoning allows scientists to conclude with virtual certainty that a hypothesis tested is true or false based on the consistency of experimental results. It is the consistency of experimental results that allows scientists to conclude that the hypothesis tested is true. This type of reasoning is fundamental to the scientific method - while we cannot achieve absolute certainty, the repeatability and consistency of experimental outcomes provide the foundation for scientific knowledge and physical laws.

                    <h2>Intensity (Light, Sound)</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The power per unit area carried by a wave, measured in watts per square meter, representing the energy flow rate through a given surface area.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Intensity follows the inverse square law for point sources - as distance from the source doubles, intensity decreases by a factor of four. For light, intensity relates to brightness as perceived by the human eye, though the relationship is logarithmic rather than linear due to the eye's response characteristics. Sound intensity determines loudness, measured on the decibel scale which is also logarithmic. The threshold of human hearing corresponds to an intensity of about 10⁻¹² watts per square meter, while the threshold of pain is about 1 watt per square meter - a range of 12 orders of magnitude. For electromagnetic radiation (light), intensity is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude. Understanding intensity is crucial for lighting design, audio engineering, laser safety, and any application involving wave energy transmission. The concept applies to all types of waves, both mechanical and nonmechanical.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A large spacecraft orbiting Earth at an altitude of approximately 400 kilometers (250 miles), serving as a laboratory for scientific research and international cooperation in space exploration.

                        The International Space Station (ISS) is one of humanity's greatest achievements in space exploration and international cooperation. Launched in 1998, it orbits Earth every 90 minutes at a speed of about 28,000 km/h (17,500 mph). The ISS operates within the ionosphere and thermosphere, where the extremely thin atmosphere still creates enough drag to gradually slow the station, requiring periodic boosts to maintain its orbit. The station serves as a unique laboratory for studying the effects of microgravity on biological systems, materials science, and atmospheric phenomena. Astronauts aboard the ISS conduct experiments that cannot be performed on Earth and provide valuable insights into atmospheric science, including studies of lightning, aurorae, and atmospheric chemistry. The ISS also serves as a testbed for technologies needed for future deep space missions.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A physical law stating that the intensity of a physical quantity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that quantity.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The inverse square law applies to many fundamental forces and phenomena in physics, including gravitational force, electromagnetic radiation, and sound intensity. For example, if you double the distance from a light source, the brightness decreases by a factor of four (2²). This law is crucial in astronomy for understanding stellar brightness, in physics for calculating gravitational and electromagnetic forces, and in many practical applications from photography to radiation safety. The mathematical relationship is expressed as I ∝ 1/r², where I is intensity and r is distance.

                        The ionosphere plays a crucial role in radio communications, as it can reflect radio waves back to Earth, enabling long-distance communication. It consists of several layers (D, E, F1, and F2) that vary in density and altitude depending on solar activity and time of day. During periods of high solar activity, the ionosphere becomes more ionized, which can enhance radio propagation but also cause disruptions to satellite communications and GPS systems. The ionosphere is also where auroras occur, as charged particles from the solar wind interact with atmospheric gases. Understanding the ionosphere is essential for space weather prediction and maintaining reliable communication systems.
