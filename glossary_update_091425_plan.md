## Definitions Based on Source Materials

### Scientific Method Terms (Module 2A):

**Scientific Method**: A logical and collaborative effort designed to determine the laws and principles of nature. It consists of two parts: the experimental method (doing experiments) and the protocol (advisory principles needed to do science).

**Equilibrioception**: The ability to sense and maintain our balance relative to the force of gravity. One of the 16 or so additional senses humans have beyond the five common senses.

**Galileo (Galileo Galilei)**: Italian physicist and astronomer who discovered that excluding aerodynamic factors, objects of dissimilar mass, released from the same height off the ground, will hit the ground at the same time.

**Galileo's Law of Falling Bodies**: The principle that excluding aerodynamic factors, objects of dissimilar mass, released from the same height off the ground, will hit the ground at the same time. This conclusion is counterintuitive but proven by experiment.

**Inductive Reasoning**: A type of thinking where while we cannot say with 100% certainty that the next time you let go of a pen it will fall straight down, you would not bet your life that it won't happen. It allows scientists to conclude with virtual certainty that a hypothesis tested is true or false based on consistency of experimental results.

**Hypothesis**: A scientifically vetted, tentative explanation of a physical phenomenon that needs to be proven (and repeatedly re-proven) by a well-designed experiment.

**Conserved Physical Quantity**: A physical quantity that can neither be created nor destroyed. Its amount (within a closed system under observation) is fixed. Examples include mass, energy, charge, linear momentum, and angular momentum.

**Geocentric Model of the Solar System**: A model stating that the Earth is the center of the solar system, meaning that the Sun, in addition to the planets and the Moon, go around the Earth. This model required complex epicycles to explain planetary retrograde motion.

**Solar System**: The gravitationally bound system consisting of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, including planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies.

**Heliocentric Model of the Solar System**: The model proposed by Copernicus stating that the Sun is at the center of the solar system, with planets orbiting around it. This model provides a much simpler explanation for planetary retrograde motion and is the correct model of the solar system.

**Principle of Falsifiability**: An advisory principle first espoused by Karl Popper stating that in order for a hypothesis to be considered scientific, it must be possible to show it is false, if in fact it is false. If a statement can never be tested by experiment, it is not scientific.

**Occam's Principle**: An advisory principle stating that whenever there are two competing hypotheses, chances are the simpler of the two is the correct one. It suggests looking at the simpler hypothesis first when exploring new phenomena.

**Constellation**: Regions or patches of the sky. There are 88 constellations in total, like patches in a spherical quilt covering the whole sky.

**Zodiacal Constellation**: The constellations that the Sun "passes through" on its yearly journey around Earth (in the geocentric model) or that the Sun appears to move through as viewed from Earth (in the heliocentric model).

**Zodiac**: The region of the sky above and below the ecliptic plane through which the planets travel, containing the zodiacal constellations.

**Astrology**: A belief system that attempts to predict human affairs based on the positions of celestial bodies. The module notes that traditional astrology has problems, including that due to precession, the Sun is not in the sign people think it is on their birthday.

**Precession**: The gradual change in orientation of Earth's axis of rotation over a period of 26,000 years, which causes the Sun signs in astrology to be off by about a month from traditional calculations.

### Temperature Terms (Module 1A):

**Temperature**: A measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. In astronomy, we associate temperature with anything that is incandescent or glowing, with hotter objects glowing blue and cooler objects glowing red.

**Temperature of the Universe**: The current average temperature of the Universe is 2.73° Kelvin, as measured from the cosmic microwave background radiation. This temperature was originally 3000° K when the CMB was released, but has cooled due to the expansion of the Universe.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix U Page
- Remove "No Terms Available" section from u.html

### Phase 2: Add Terms by Letter
- **Letter A**: Astrology
- **Letter C**: Constellation, Conserved Physical Quantity  
- **Letter E**: Equilibrioception
- **Letter G**: Galileo (Galilei), Galileo's Law of Falling Bodies, Geocentric Model of the Solar System
- **Letter H**: Hypothesis, Heliocentric Model of the Solar System
- **Letter I**: Inductive Reasoning
- **Letter O**: Occam's Principle
- **Letter P**: Principle of Falsifiability, Precession
- **Letter S**: Scientific Method, Solar System
- **Letter T**: Temperature, Temperature of the Universe
- **Letter Z**: Zodiac, Zodiacal Constellation

### Phase 3: Alphabetization Rules
- **People**: Sort by last name (Galileo under G for Galilei)
- **Concepts**: Sort by first letter of the term
- Maintain existing alphabetical order within each letter

### Phase 4: Quality Control
- Ensure no unauthorized deletions
- Maintain Wikipedia links where appropriate
- Preserve existing formatting and style
- Test all pages for functionality

## Notes
- All definitions are based on the provided Module 1A and 2A materials
- Maintain consistency with existing glossary style
- Preserve all previous corrections and improvements
- Follow established alphabetization guide
