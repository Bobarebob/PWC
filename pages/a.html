                    <h2>Accuracy</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The degree of closeness between a measurement and its true or accepted value, indicating how correct a measurement is.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Accuracy is often confused with precision, but they represent different aspects of measurement quality. While accuracy measures how close you are to the true value, precision measures how close repeated measurements are to each other. A measurement can be precise but not accurate (consistently wrong), accurate but not precise (correct on average but scattered), or both accurate and precise (the ideal case). For example, if the true length of an object is 10.0 cm, measurements of 9.9, 10.0, and 10.1 cm would be accurate, while measurements of 8.1, 8.2, and 8.1 cm would be precise but not accurate.

                        Analog devices differ from digital devices in that they use continuous scales rather than discrete digital displays. Examples include micrometer calipers, metric metal rulers, beam balance scales, and graduated cylinders. For analog devices, the tolerance or instrument limiting error is typically determined using the "one-half rule" - taking the tolerance to be half of the least count, because we can conservatively say we can "see" 2 parts in the least count.

                        The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31 or M31, is the most distant object visible to the naked eye under dark skies. It is a spiral galaxy similar to our own Milky Way but significantly larger, spanning about 220,000 light-years in diameter. Andromeda is approaching our galaxy at about 250,000 mph and is expected to collide with the Milky Way in approximately 4.5 billion years, forming a new elliptical galaxy sometimes called "Milkomeda." The galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center and is accompanied by several smaller satellite galaxies, including M32 and M110.

                        Ancient Greek philosopher and scientist (384-322 BCE) who made foundational contributions to logic, natural philosophy, and the scientific method, famously stating that "knowledge is the product of experience."

                        Aristotle's principle that "knowledge is the product of experience" forms the philosophical foundation of the modern scientific method. He emphasized that we learn about the external world through data acquired through our senses, establishing the empirical approach that underlies all scientific investigation. His systematic approach to observation and logical reasoning laid the groundwork for experimental science, making him one of the most influential figures in the development of scientific thinking.

                        Asterisms are more general than constellations and can be any identified star pattern. They can be part of a constellation (like the Big Dipper within Ursa Major), span multiple constellations (like the Summer Triangle formed by stars from three different constellations), or be smaller patterns within constellations. Famous asterisms include the Big Dipper, Little Dipper, Orion's Belt, the Summer Triangle, and the Winter Triangle. Unlike the 88 officially recognized constellations, asterisms are informal star patterns that have been identified by various cultures throughout history.

                        An ancient astronomical instrument used for navigation and timekeeping, consisting of a flat circular disk with a rotating overlay that models the movement of celestial objects.

                    <div class="context">
                        The astrolabe was one of the most important scientific instruments of the medieval period, used by astronomers, navigators, and astrologers from ancient Greece through the Islamic Golden Age and into Renaissance Europe. It could determine local time, the time of sunrise and sunset, the direction of Mecca for Islamic prayers, and latitude for navigation. The instrument consists of a base plate (mater) with climate-specific star maps, a rotating star chart (rete), and a rule for measurements. While largely replaced by more accurate modern instruments, astrolabes remain important for understanding the history of astronomy and navigation, and are still used today for educational purposes and by some traditional navigators.

                        Astrobiology combines aspects of astronomy, biology, and geology to understand how life might arise and evolve in different environments. NASA's astrobiology program addresses three fundamental questions: How does life begin and evolve? Does life exist elsewhere in the Universe? What is the future of life on Earth and beyond? This interdisciplinary field emerged in the 1990s and has become central to space exploration missions, including the search for biosignatures on Mars and the study of potentially habitable exoplanets.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A belief system that attempts to predict human affairs and terrestrial events based on the positions and movements of celestial bodies.

                    <div class="context">
                        Traditional astrology claims there are 12 zodiacal constellations, but the Sun actually passes through 13 constellations, including Ophiuchus between Scorpius and Sagittarius. Due to the precession of Earth's axis over 26,000 years, the Sun on your birthday is not in the astrological sign traditionally assigned to that date - it's off by about a month. For example, if traditional astrology says your Sun sign is Virgo (August 23-September 22), the Sun is actually in Virgo between September 16-October 30. While astrology has historical and cultural significance, it is not considered a science as its claims cannot be tested through the scientific method.

                        A unit of length defined to be exactly equal to 149,597,870.7 kilometers (92,955,807.3 miles), approximately the average distance between Earth and the Sun.

                        The astronomical unit serves as a fundamental measurement for distances within our solar system and provides a convenient scale for expressing planetary distances. For example, Mars orbits at about 1.5 AU from the Sun, while Jupiter is approximately 5.2 AU away. The AU is also used in defining other astronomical distance units - one parsec equals about 206,265 AU. Originally conceived as the semi-major axis of Earth's orbit, the AU was redefined in 2012 by the International Astronomical Union as an exact value to provide a stable reference for astronomical measurements.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The angle between a planet's rotational axis and the perpendicular to its orbital plane, which determines the planet's seasons and climate patterns.

                    <div class="context">
                        Earth's axial tilt of approximately 23.5 degrees is responsible for our seasonal changes as different hemispheres receive varying amounts of direct sunlight throughout the year. During summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole tilts toward the Sun, resulting in longer days and more direct sunlight. Mars has a similar axial tilt to Earth (about 25 degrees), giving it comparable seasonal patterns, though its seasons last about twice as long due to its longer orbital period. Venus has an extreme axial tilt of about 177 degrees, meaning it rotates nearly upside down, while Uranus has an axial tilt of 98 degrees, essentially rotating on its side.
