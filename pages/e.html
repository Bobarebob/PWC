                    <div class="definition">
                        American aviation pioneer (1897-1937) who was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and mysteriously disappeared while attempting to circumnavigate the globe.

                        Amelia Mary Earhart became an international icon for her aviation achievements and advocacy for women's rights. She set numerous aviation records, including being the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932. Her disappearance on July 2, 1937, during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe near Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean, remains one of aviation's greatest mysteries. Earhart's legacy continues to inspire generations of aviators and serves as a symbol of courage, determination, and the pursuit of scientific and technological advancement.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The average distance between the centers of Earth and the Moon, approximately 239,000 miles (384,400 kilometers), regularly measured using laser ranging to reflectors placed on the lunar surface.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The Earth-Moon distance is precisely measured by shining laser beams off retroreflectors placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts and Soviet rovers. This distance varies due to the Moon's elliptical orbit, ranging from about 225,700 miles (perigee) to 252,000 miles (apogee). The Moon is gradually moving away from Earth at about 3.8 centimeters per year due to tidal forces. When the Moon first formed about 4.5 billion years ago, it was much closer to Earth - probably only about 24,000 miles away, or about 10 times closer than today. This distance is often used as a reference for other astronomical measurements within our solar system.

                        Enceladus is considered one of the most promising places in our solar system to search for life. The Cassini spacecraft discovered that the moon's south polar region has active geysers containing water, salts, and organic molecules, suggesting a warm, potentially habitable ocean beneath its icy surface. The tidal heating from Saturn keeps this ocean liquid.

                        Endosymbiosis is believed to be responsible for the evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells, representing a crucial step in the development of complex life on Earth. This process is considered one of the unlikely events cited in the Rare Earth Hypothesis, as it required precise conditions and timing.

                        The ability to sense and maintain our balance relative to the force of gravity, one of the 16 or so additional senses humans have beyond the five common senses.

                        Equilibrioception is an example of how we learn about the external world through sensory data, as described by Aristotle's principle that "knowledge is the product of experience." This sense works in conjunction with the vestibular system in our inner ear to help us maintain balance and spatial orientation. While we commonly think of only five senses (seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, tasting), humans actually have many more senses including equilibrioception, as well as senses of itching, hunger, and relative humidity.

                        Europa is a prime target for astrobiology research due to its subsurface ocean, which is kept liquid by tidal heating from Jupiter's gravitational pull. Future missions like NASA's Europa Clipper aim to study this moon's potential for harboring life. The ocean likely has direct contact with the rocky seafloor, potentially creating hydrothermal vents.

                        The EHT achieved the first direct image of a black hole's event horizon in 2019, capturing the supermassive black hole in galaxy M87. This groundbreaking achievement required precise coordination of telescopes around the world, using a technique called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The project later captured the first image of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. These images provided the first direct visual evidence of black holes and confirmed predictions of Einstein's general theory of relativity.
