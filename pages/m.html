                        Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects - a proposed form of dark matter consisting of ordinary matter that is simply too dim to detect directly, such as brown dwarfs, black holes, or rogue planets.

                        MACHOs represent one of two main candidates for dark matter (the other being WIMPs). These objects would be composed of baryonic matter but would be difficult to observe because they emit little or no light. While some MACHOs certainly exist, observations suggest they cannot account for all of the dark matter in the universe, leading to greater focus on exotic particle candidates like WIMPs.

                        Earth's magnetosphere extends from about 1,000 km above the surface to over 65,000 km on the sunward side, and much farther on the night side due to solar wind pressure. This magnetic shield is crucial for life on Earth, as it prevents the solar wind from stripping away our atmosphere and protects us from harmful cosmic radiation. Mars lacks an active magnetosphere, which may explain why its atmosphere is so thin - the solar wind has gradually stripped it away over billions of years. However, Mars does have residual "magnetic umbrellas" near its south pole, and aurorae occur planetwide when solar wind particles interact with these remnant magnetic fields.

                        Mars has two small "asteroid" moons, Deimos and Phobos, and lacks an active magnetosphere, making its surface subject to solar wind bombardment. The planet features the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, which stands 72,000 feet tall - two and a half times taller than Mount Everest. Mars has an axial tilt and rotation period quite similar to Earth, with a Martian day lasting a little less than 25 Earth hours and exhibiting four seasons. Since Mars is about 1.5 times farther from the Sun than Earth, its year lasts nearly 2 Earth years, and its seasons are about twice as long. The thin atmosphere retains very little solar warmth, with surface temperatures ranging from -225°F at night to +95°F during the day.

                        Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate and interact, predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves that travel at the speed of light. This led him to conclude that light itself is an electromagnetic wave, unifying optics with electromagnetic theory. His work laid the foundation for modern physics and technology, enabling the development of radio, television, radar, and wireless communications. Maxwell's electromagnetic theory also predicted the full electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Einstein called Maxwell's work "the most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton." Maxwell's kinetic theory of gases also contributed to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. His mathematical framework remains fundamental to understanding electromagnetic phenomena and continues to be essential for modern technology and scientific research.

                        In graduated cylinders, water creates a sort of half "U" shape due to the meniscus effect. This complicates liquid volume measurements because you must decide whether to read from the top or bottom of the meniscus. When using the top of the meniscus and viewing the water level straight on (at water level height to avoid parallax), you can actually see 5 parts in the least count, achieving better precision than the simple 50% rule would suggest.

This layer is where most meteoroids burn up due to friction with atmospheric particles, creating the "shooting stars" we observe from Earth's surface. The mesosphere also contains noctilucent clouds, the highest clouds in Earth's atmosphere, which form around 80-85 km altitude and are visible during summer twilight at high latitudes. The mesosphere is difficult to study directly because it's too high for aircraft and balloons but too low for satellites, earning it the nickname "ignorosphere." However, it plays important roles in atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, including the destruction of ozone and the propagation of atmospheric waves from lower layers.

Meteorologists analyze atmospheric conditions using various tools including weather stations, satellites, radar, and computer models to understand and predict weather patterns. The field includes several specializations: synoptic meteorology (large-scale weather systems), mesoscale meteorology (regional weather phenomena), microscale meteorology (local atmospheric processes), and climatology (long-term weather patterns). Modern meteorology relies heavily on numerical weather prediction models that solve complex mathematical equations describing atmospheric behavior. Understanding atmospheric science is crucial for aviation safety, agriculture, disaster preparedness, and climate change research.

                        The terminology reflects the object's location and state: meteoroids range from dust grains to small asteroids while still in space, typically measuring from micrometers to several meters across. When a meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere at high speed (typically 11-72 km/s), friction with air molecules creates intense heat that vaporizes the object and surrounding air, producing the bright streak of light called a meteor or "shooting star." Most meteoroids completely burn up in the atmosphere, but larger ones may survive the journey and impact the surface as meteorites. Meteorites provide valuable scientific information about the early solar system, asteroid composition, and planetary formation processes. Different types include iron meteorites (metallic), stony meteorites (rocky), and stony-iron meteorites (mixed composition). Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through debris trails left by comets.

Natural sources include wetlands, termites, oceans, and geological processes, while anthropogenic sources include agriculture (especially livestock and rice cultivation), fossil fuel extraction and processing, landfills, and biomass burning. Although methane concentrations in the atmosphere are much lower than carbon dioxide, methane is approximately 25 times more effective at trapping heat over a 100-year period, making it a potent greenhouse gas. In the atmosphere, methane has a relatively short lifetime of about 9 years before being oxidized to carbon dioxide and water vapor. Methane also plays important roles in atmospheric chemistry, participating in reactions that affect ozone formation and hydroxyl radical concentrations. Understanding methane sources and sinks is crucial for climate change mitigation strategies.

                        Microbursts are among the most dangerous weather phenomena for aviation, capable of producing wind speeds exceeding 100 mph in a very small area (typically less than 4 km in diameter). They form when rain or hail falls from a thunderstorm and evaporates or sublimates in dry air below the cloud, cooling the air and causing it to accelerate downward. When this column of air hits the ground, it spreads outward in all directions, creating a divergent wind pattern. Aircraft encountering a microburst experience first a headwind (causing lift), then a strong downdraft, followed by a tailwind (causing rapid loss of lift). This sequence can cause aircraft to lose altitude rapidly and has been responsible for several aviation accidents. Modern Doppler radar systems can detect microbursts, providing crucial warnings to pilots and air traffic controllers.

For analog devices like micrometers, the "one-half rule" is used - the tolerance is half of the least count (0.005 mm). Measurements are written as 15.500 ± 0.005 mm, demonstrating the high precision achievable with this instrument.

                        Microwave radiation is crucial in astronomy, particularly the cosmic microwave background (CMB) which is the afterglow of the Big Bang. This radiation provides a snapshot of the universe when it was only 380,000 years old and has been redshifted from visible light to microwave frequencies due to cosmic expansion.

                        The MKS system served as the foundation for the modern International System of Units (SI). In this course, we focus almost exclusively on the MKS metric system, which provides the base units for most scientific measurements. The MKS system offers advantages over other systems like CGS (centimeter-gram-second) due to its practical unit sizes and direct relationship to SI units. For example, force is measured in newtons (kg⋅m/s²) and energy in joules (kg⋅m²/s²), making calculations more straightforward than in the CGS system.

                        For an observer on Earth, the idea of a month is firmly connected with a lunation, or synodic month - the time between one new moon and the next new moon (29.5 days). This is different from the sidereal month, which is the time for the Moon to orbit Earth compared to the faraway stars (27.3 days). The synodic month is longer because Earth moves through its orbit during a lunation, so the Earth must rotate a few more times before an Earthbound observer sees a new moon again. Modern calendar months are approximations of the lunar month, though they have been standardized for practical purposes.

                        The Moon is almost as old as Earth (4.543 billion years) and was initially much closer - probably only about 24,000 miles away compared to today's average distance of 239,000 miles. Over billions of years, the Moon has "stolen" rotational kinetic energy from Earth through tidal action, causing Earth's rotation to slow and the Moon to migrate outward. The Moon is now tidally locked with Earth, showing only one side (the near side) to Earthbound observers. The far side is not permanently dark but simply cannot be seen from Earth. The Moon's angular size in the sky is surprisingly small - your pinky finger at arm's length easily covers it completely, even though it appears huge due to the Moon Illusion.

                        An optical illusion that causes the Moon to appear larger when it is near the horizon compared to when it is high in the sky, even though its actual angular size remains constant.

                    <div class="context">
                        The Moon Illusion is a psychological phenomenon rather than a physical one - the Moon's actual size in the sky doesn't change as it moves from horizon to zenith. Your pinky finger at arm's length always covers the Moon completely, demonstrating that its angular size remains constant at about 0.5 degrees. The illusion occurs because our brain interprets the Moon's size relative to objects on the horizon (trees, buildings, mountains), making it appear larger. When the Moon is high in the sky with no reference objects, it appears smaller even though it's the same angular size. This illusion has puzzled humans for millennia and demonstrates how our perception can differ from physical reality.

                        A stratovolcano in the Philippines whose catastrophic eruption on June 15, 1991, was the second-largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century and significantly impacted global climate and atmospheric composition.

                    <div class="context">
                        The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption injected approximately 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, forming sulfuric acid aerosols that circled the globe and reflected sunlight back to space. This caused global average temperatures to drop by about 0.5°C (0.9°F) for 2-3 years following the eruption, demonstrating the powerful influence volcanic activity can have on Earth's climate system. The eruption also temporarily depleted stratospheric ozone and created spectacular sunsets worldwide due to light scattering by volcanic aerosols. Mount Pinatubo's eruption provided scientists with valuable data about volcanic impacts on climate and atmospheric chemistry, serving as a natural experiment for understanding how large-scale atmospheric interventions might affect global temperatures. The event highlighted the importance of monitoring volcanic activity for both local hazard assessment and global climate research.

                    <div class="context">
                        The multiverse concept arose from attempts to explain why the fundamental constants of our universe appear to be fine-tuned for life. If infinite universes exist with different constants, we naturally find ourselves in one suitable for life. While the multiverse remains highly speculative and untestable, it offers a potential explanation for the apparent fine-tuning of physical constants without requiring divine intervention or special design. Various theories in cosmology and quantum mechanics, including eternal inflation and many-worlds interpretation, suggest mechanisms by which multiple universes could exist. However, the multiverse hypothesis faces criticism for being unfalsifiable and therefore unscientific according to traditional scientific methodology.
