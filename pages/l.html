                    <h2>Least Count</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The smallest scale division of a measuring device.

                    <div class="context">
                        For digital devices like digital calipers, the least count is typically 0.01 mm because the measurement can only increment up or down by this amount - it's discrete, not continuous. For analog devices like micrometers, the least count is the space between adjacent markings, typically 0.01 mm. The tolerance or instrument limiting error for any measuring device is chosen based on the least count of that device, typically as a fraction or percentage of the least count.

                    <h2>Georges Lemaître</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Belgian priest, physicist, and astronomer who first proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory, calling it the "hypothesis of the primeval atom."

                    <div class="context">
                        In 1927, Lemaître independently derived what is now called the Hubble-Lemaître Law, showing that the universe is expanding. He later proposed that the universe began from a single "primeval atom" that exploded and expanded to create everything we see today. Lemaître is considered the father of the Big Bang theory, fundamentally changing our understanding of cosmic origins and the universe's evolution.

                    <div class="definition">
                        Electromagnetic radiation, whether visible to the human eye or not, traveling at approximately 299,792,458 meters per second in a vacuum.

                        Light is fundamental to our understanding of the universe, serving as the primary means by which we observe distant objects. The speed of light is a universal constant that plays a crucial role in Einstein's theories of relativity. Light exhibits both wave and particle properties, a concept known as wave-particle duality.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days), equal to approximately 9.46 trillion kilometers or 5.88 trillion miles.

                    <div class="context">
                        The light-year is a fundamental unit for measuring astronomical distances, particularly useful for expressing distances to stars and galaxies. For perspective, the nearest star to our Sun, Proxima Centauri, is about 4.24 light-years away, meaning the light we see from it today left the star over four years ago. One light-year equals about 63,241 astronomical units, and about 3.26 light-years equal one parsec. This unit helps us understand the vast scales of the universe and the time it takes for light to travel between celestial objects.

                    <div class="definition">
                        Coulomb's constant (k), a fundamental physical constant that determines the strength of the electromagnetic force between charged particles.

                    <div class="context">
                        Coulomb's constant has a value of approximately 8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C². Like other fundamental constants, its precise value appears to be fine-tuned to allow for the formation of atoms, molecules, and ultimately life. If little k were significantly different, atoms might not be stable, chemical bonds might not form properly, and the universe might not develop the complexity necessary for life.
