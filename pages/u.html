                        The observable universe is estimated to be about 93 billion light-years in diameter and contains over 2 trillion galaxies. It began with the Big Bang approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. The universe consists of about 5% ordinary matter, 27% dark matter, and 68% dark energy.

                    <h2>Universe – Expansion Rate</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The rate at which the universe is expanding, measured by the Hubble constant, currently estimated at about 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The expansion rate determines how fast distant galaxies are moving away from us. This rate has changed over cosmic time - initially slowing due to gravity, then accelerating due to dark energy starting about 5 billion years ago. Precise measurements of this rate help determine the universe's age and fate.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The current average temperature of the universe is approximately 2.73 Kelvin (-270.42°C), as measured by the cosmic microwave background radiation.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The universe has been cooling since the Big Bang as it expands. Initially infinitely hot, it cooled to about 3000 K when atoms first formed, and the radiation from that time has been redshifted to the current 2.73 K. This temperature will continue to decrease as the universe expands.
