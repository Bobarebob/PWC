                    <h2>Dark Energy</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A mysterious form of energy that permeates all of space and causes the accelerating expansion of the universe, comprising approximately 71.4% of the total universe.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Dark energy was discovered in 1998 through observations of distant Type Ia supernovae. Unlike matter, which becomes less dense as the universe expands, dark energy appears to maintain constant density or even increase as space expands. Dark energy is one of the greatest mysteries in modern physics, fundamentally challenging our understanding of space, time, and the ultimate fate of the universe.

                    <div class="definition">
                        An invisible form of matter that interacts gravitationally but not electromagnetically, comprising approximately 24% of the universe and providing the gravitational scaffolding for galaxy formation.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Dark matter doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it detectable only through its gravitational effects. Without dark matter, galaxies would fly apart during rotation, and the large-scale structure of the universe couldn't have formed. Dark matter is essential for explaining galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the formation of cosmic structure, yet its fundamental nature remains unknown.

                    <h2>Drake's Equation</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A probabilistic equation formulated by Frank Drake in 1961 to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The equation is: N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L, where each factor represents different aspects of star formation, planetary development, and the emergence of communicative civilizations. While the equation cannot provide precise numbers due to uncertain parameters, it serves as a framework for scientific discussion about extraterrestrial life. The equation has become the backbone of SETI research and astrobiology.

                    <div class="definition">
                        American astronomer and astrophysicist (1930-2022) who pioneered the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and formulated the famous Drake Equation.

                    <div class="context">
                        Drake conducted the first systematic SETI search called Project Ozma in 1960 and organized the first scientific meeting on SETI in 1961. His equation became the foundation for scientific discussions about the probability of extraterrestrial civilizations. He was a founding member of the SETI Institute and remained active in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence throughout his career.
