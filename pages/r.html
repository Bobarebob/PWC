                    <h2>Rare Earth Hypothesis</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The hypothesis that the emergence of complex life on Earth required an improbable combination of astrophysical and geological circumstances, making Earth-like planets and complex life extremely rare in the universe.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Proposed by Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee, this hypothesis suggests that while simple life may be common, complex life requires numerous unlikely events including the formation of the Moon, plate tectonics, a large moon for tidal effects, and protection from a gas giant like Jupiter. This hypothesis offers an explanation for Fermi's Paradox by suggesting that complex, intelligent life is extremely rare.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The period in cosmic history, about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe cooled enough for electrons and protons to combine and form neutral hydrogen, helium and other atoms for the first time.

                    <div class="context">
                        Before recombination, the universe was opaque to light because free electrons scattered photons. After recombination, the universe became transparent, allowing light to travel freely through space for the first time. The recombination epoch marks the release of the cosmic microwave background radiation, providing us with our earliest direct view of the universe and crucial information about its early conditions.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The phenomenon where light from distant objects is shifted toward longer (redder) wavelengths, indicating that the object is moving away from the observer.

                    <div class="context">
                        Redshift is crucial evidence for the expanding universe. There are three types: Doppler redshift (due to motion), gravitational redshift (due to gravity), and cosmological redshift (due to space expansion). Edwin Hubble's observations of galactic redshift led to the discovery that the universe is expanding.

                    <h2>Red Supergiant</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A massive star in the later stages of stellar evolution, characterized by its enormous size, cool surface temperature, and red color, representing one of the largest types of stars in the universe.

                    <div class="context">
                        Red supergiants are evolved massive stars (typically 8-40 times the mass of the Sun) that have exhausted the hydrogen in their cores and expanded to enormous sizes. Despite their cool surface temperatures (around 3,000-4,500 K), they are extremely luminous due to their vast surface area. Famous examples include Betelgeuse in Orion and Antares in Scorpius. These stars are in the final stages of their lives and will eventually explode as supernovae, potentially leaving behind neutron stars or black holes. Their red color comes from their relatively cool surface temperature compared to other types of stars.

                        American astrophysicist and Nobel Prize laureate who co-discovered the accelerating expansion of the universe through observations of distant Type Ia supernovae.

                    <div class="context">
                        In 1998, Adam Riess, along with Saul Perlmutter and Brian Schmidt, published groundbreaking research showing that the universe's expansion is accelerating rather than slowing down. This discovery revolutionized cosmology and led to the concept of dark energy. Riess shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work, fundamentally changing our understanding of the universe's fate and composition, revealing that dark energy makes up about 71% of the universe.

                        American astronomer who provided compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter through her observations of galaxy rotation curves.

                        Vera Rubin (1928-2016) discovered that stars in the outer regions of galaxies were moving faster than expected based on visible matter alone. Her work in the 1970s showed that galaxies must contain much more mass than we can see, leading to the modern understanding of dark matter. She was a pioneer for women in astronomy.
