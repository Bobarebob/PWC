                    <h2>Brian Schmidt</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Australian-American astrophysicist and Nobel Prize laureate who co-discovered the accelerating expansion of the universe through observations of distant supernovae.

                    <div class="context">
                        As leader of the High-Z Supernova Search Team, Schmidt worked alongside Adam Riess and competed with Saul Perlmutter's team to measure the universe's expansion rate using Type Ia supernovae as standard candles. Schmidt shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering that the universe's expansion is accelerating, fundamentally changing our understanding of cosmology and leading to the concept of dark energy.

                    <h2>Scientific Measurement</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A quantitative observation composed of three essential parts: a best guess or best estimate, a tolerance or instrument limiting error, and a unit.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Every scientific measurement follows the format: best guess ± tolerance unit. For example, 12.34 ± 0.02 cm represents a complete scientific measurement where 12.34 is the best guess, ± 0.02 is the tolerance, and cm is the unit. Scientific measurements are fundamentally probability statements - we acknowledge that no measurement can be written with absolute certainty, but we can assign a probability that the confidence interval captures the true value of the measurement.

                    <h2>Scientific Method</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A logical and collaborative effort designed to determine the laws and principles of nature, consisting of two parts: the experimental method (doing experiments) and the protocol (advisory principles needed to do science).
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The scientific method is based on Aristotle's principle that "knowledge is the product of experience" - we learn about the external world through data acquired through our senses. Experiments are logical procedures that attempt to prove or disprove hypotheses using qualitative and quantitative observations, and must be repeatable. The method requires that all scientific knowledge be verified through experiment, and includes advisory principles like Occam's Principle and the Principle of Falsifiability to guide scientific investigation.

                    <h2>Scientific Theory</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A proven hypothesis that has been conclusively demonstrated through repeated experimentation and observation. In science, a theory is a fact, not a speculation.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        When an hypothesis is conclusively proven by experiment, it becomes a scientific theory or fact. This represents the highest level of scientific certainty achievable through the scientific method. Scientific theories of general applicability are called physical laws or physical principles, such as Newton's Law of Gravity or Archimedes' Principle. The term "theory" in science has a much stronger meaning than in everyday language - it represents established scientific knowledge that has been repeatedly verified through experimentation and observation.

                    <h2>Second Law of Thermodynamics</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A fundamental principle of physics stating that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time, and that energy spontaneously flows from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        This law is crucial in astrobiology for understanding how life maintains order and complexity in a universe trending toward disorder. Living organisms create local decreases in entropy by consuming energy, which is consistent with the Second Law when considering the system as a whole. The law helps explain why life requires a continuous input of energy to maintain its organized state.

                        SETI research began in earnest in the 1960s with Frank Drake's Project Ozma and continues today through organizations like the SETI Institute.

The field has expanded to include searches for technosignatures and optical signals.

                        American astronomer who first discovered that distant galaxies are redshifted, providing the initial observational evidence for the expansion of the universe before Edwin Hubble's more famous work.

                    <div class="context">
                        Working at Lowell Observatory in the 1910s and 1920s, Slipher measured the spectra of spiral nebulae (now known to be galaxies) and found that most were redshifted, indicating they were moving away from Earth. Slipher's redshift measurements provided the crucial observational foundation for Hubble's later discovery of the expanding universe and the formulation of Hubble's Law.

                    <div class="context">
                        The correct model of the solar system is the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus, where the Sun is at the center and planets orbit around it. This model replaced the complex geocentric model that required epicycles and deferents to explain planetary motion. In the heliocentric model, planets closer to the Sun orbit faster (Kepler's Third Law), which elegantly explains the apparent retrograde motion of planets as viewed from Earth. The solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant molecular cloud.
