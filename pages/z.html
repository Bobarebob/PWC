                        The region of the sky above and below the ecliptic plane through which the planets travel, containing the zodiacal constellations.

                        The zodiac is the band of sky through which the Sun appears to move during its yearly journey as viewed from Earth. This region contains the constellations that the Sun "passes through" on its apparent annual path. Traditional astrology recognizes 12 zodiacal constellations, but the Sun actually passes through 13 constellations, including Ophiuchus between Scorpius and Sagittarius. Due to precession of Earth's axis over 26,000 years, the actual positions of zodiacal constellations have shifted from their traditional astrological assignments.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The constellations that the Sun appears to pass through on its yearly journey around Earth (in the geocentric model) or that the Sun appears to move through as viewed from Earth (in the heliocentric model).

                        There are actually 13 zodiacal constellations, not the 12 traditionally recognized by astrology. The 13th constellation is Ophiuchus, located between Scorpius and Sagittarius. These constellations form the backdrop for the Sun's apparent annual motion through the sky, which is actually due to Earth's orbital motion around the Sun. The zodiacal constellations have been used for navigation, timekeeping, and astrological purposes throughout human history.
