                    <div class="definition">
                        A mysterious form of energy that permeates all of space and causes the accelerating expansion of the universe, comprising approximately 71.4% of the total universe.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Dark energy was discovered in 1998 through observations of distant Type Ia supernovae. Unlike matter, which becomes less dense as the universe expands, dark energy appears to maintain constant density or even increase as space expands. Dark energy is one of the greatest mysteries in modern physics, fundamentally challenging our understanding of space, time, and the ultimate fate of the universe.

Dark matter is essential for explaining galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the formation of cosmic structure, yet its fundamental nature remains unknown.

                        Dawn occurs when the Sun is still below the horizon but its light begins to illuminate the sky through atmospheric scattering. There are three types of dawn: astronomical dawn (Sun 18° below horizon), nautical dawn (Sun 12° below horizon), and civil dawn (Sun 6° below horizon). Civil dawn is when there is enough light for most outdoor activities without artificial lighting. Dawn is the counterpart to dusk, which occurs in the evening after sunset.

                        Daylight Saving Time (DST) is observed in many countries to maximize the use of natural daylight during evening hours. In the United States, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. The practice was first widely implemented during World War I to conserve energy. While the energy savings are now minimal, DST continues in many regions, though its benefits and drawbacks remain subjects of ongoing debate.

                        Phobos is the larger and closer moon, orbiting Mars in just 7.6 hours at a distance of only 6,000 km above the surface. It is so close that it orbits faster than Mars rotates, causing it to rise in the west and set in the east as seen from Mars. Deimos is smaller and more distant, orbiting in 30.3 hours at about 20,000 km altitude. Both moons are thought to be captured asteroids due to their irregular shapes and composition. Phobos is gradually spiraling inward and will either crash into Mars or break apart into a ring system in about 50 million years. These "asteroid moons" are much smaller than Earth's Moon, with Phobos being about 22 km across and Deimos only 12 km across.

                        Dew point temperature is a fundamental concept in atmospheric science and meteorology, providing a direct measure of atmospheric moisture content. Unlike relative humidity, which depends on both moisture and temperature, dew point gives an absolute measure of water vapor in the air. When air temperature equals the dew point, the air is saturated and condensation occurs, forming dew, fog, or clouds. Higher dew points indicate more moisture in the atmosphere and often correlate with uncomfortable, humid conditions. Dew point is crucial for weather forecasting, as it helps predict fog formation, precipitation likelihood, and comfort levels. In aviation, dew point spread (the difference between temperature and dew point) is used to assess visibility conditions.

                    <div class="context">
                        Diffraction occurs when light waves encounter edges, slits, or obstacles that are comparable in size to the wavelength of light. This phenomenon provides direct evidence that light behaves as a wave, not just as particles. When light passes through a narrow opening, it spreads out in a characteristic pattern of bright and dark regions called a diffraction pattern. The amount of diffraction depends on the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the opening - smaller openings relative to wavelength produce more pronounced diffraction. Diffraction explains why we can hear around corners but cannot see around them (sound wavelengths are much larger than light wavelengths). This principle is fundamental to many optical instruments including telescopes, microscopes, and spectrometers. Diffraction gratings, which contain thousands of parallel slits, are used to separate light into its component wavelengths for spectroscopic analysis. Understanding diffraction is essential for optical design and explains the fundamental resolution limits of optical instruments.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The reflection of light in multiple directions from rough or irregular surfaces, where incident light rays are scattered rather than reflected at a single angle.

                    <div class="context">
                        Diffuse reflection occurs when light strikes a surface that has irregularities larger than the wavelength of the incident light, causing the reflected rays to scatter in many directions. This is in contrast to specular reflection, where light reflects at a predictable angle from smooth surfaces like mirrors. Most everyday objects exhibit diffuse reflection, which is why we can see them from various angles - the scattered light reaches our eyes regardless of our viewing position. The roughness of the surface determines the degree of diffusion: paper, fabric, and painted walls show strong diffuse reflection, while polished metals show primarily specular reflection. Diffuse reflection is essential for general illumination and visibility of objects. It follows Lambert's cosine law, where the reflected intensity varies with the cosine of the angle from the surface normal. Understanding diffuse reflection is crucial for lighting design, photography, and computer graphics rendering.

The tolerance for digital calipers is typically 100% of the least count (0.01 mm), so measurements are written as 12.34 ± 0.01 mm.

                        The separation of light into its component wavelengths when passing through a medium, caused by the wavelength-dependent variation in the speed of light through different materials.

                    <div class="context">
                        Dispersion occurs because different wavelengths of light travel at slightly different speeds through transparent materials, causing them to bend by different amounts when entering or exiting the material. This wavelength-dependent refraction is what creates rainbows when sunlight passes through water droplets, and what allows prisms to separate white light into its constituent colors. The degree of dispersion depends on the material's refractive index variation with wavelength. Crown glass shows less dispersion than flint glass, which is why telescope and camera lenses often combine different glass types to minimize chromatic aberration. Dispersion is fundamental to spectroscopy, where it enables the analysis of light to determine the composition of distant stars and other objects. Understanding dispersion is essential for optical instrument design, fiber optic communications, and any application requiring precise control of different wavelengths of light.

                    <div class="context">
                        Named after Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, this effect occurs with all types of waves including sound, light, and radio waves. When the source moves toward the observer, the observed frequency increases (higher pitch for sound, blue shift for light). When the source moves away, the frequency decreases (lower pitch, red shift). The Doppler effect is fundamental to many technologies and scientific observations: radar and sonar use it to measure speeds, medical ultrasound uses it to measure blood flow, and astronomers use it to determine the motion of stars and galaxies. The cosmological redshift of distant galaxies, caused by the expansion of the universe, is a relativistic Doppler effect that provided key evidence for the Big Bang theory. Weather radar uses the Doppler effect to measure wind speeds and detect rotation in storms. Understanding the Doppler effect is essential for astronomy, meteorology, medical imaging, and many other fields.

                    <h2>Drake's Equation</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A probabilistic equation formulated by Frank Drake in 1961 to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy.

                    <div class="context">
                        The equation is: N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L, where each factor represents different aspects of star formation, planetary development, and the emergence of communicative civilizations. While the equation cannot provide precise numbers due to uncertain parameters, it serves as a framework for scientific discussion about extraterrestrial life. The equation has become the backbone of SETI research and astrobiology.

                    <h2>Dusk</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The darkest stage of twilight in the evening, occurring at the very end of astronomical twilight after sunset and just before nightfall.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Dusk marks the transition from twilight to night, when the Sun is far enough below the horizon that indirect sunlight no longer illuminates the sky. Like dawn, dusk has three stages: civil dusk (Sun 6° below horizon), nautical dusk (Sun 12° below horizon), and astronomical dusk (Sun 18° below horizon). Astronomical dusk represents true nightfall, when the sky becomes completely dark and astronomical observations can begin. Dusk is the evening counterpart to dawn.
