                        Callisto is considered one of the most promising targets for astrobiology research due to its subsurface ocean, which may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. The moon's relatively stable environment and distance from Jupiter's intense radiation make it an attractive target for future exploration missions. Unlike Europa, Callisto's ocean is likely separated from its rocky core by a layer of ice, but it still represents a potentially habitable environment.

                        Carbon dioxide is a key greenhouse gas that traps heat in Earth's atmosphere through the greenhouse effect. While it represents a small fraction of the atmosphere by volume, its concentration has increased by over 40% since pre-industrial times due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. CO₂ is essential for photosynthesis in plants and is part of the natural carbon cycle, but elevated levels contribute to global warming and climate change. The gas is also found in the atmosphere of Venus, where it creates extreme greenhouse effects. Atmospheric CO₂ levels are measured at observatories like Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and serve as a key indicator of climate change.

                    <div class="context">
                        The Celsius scale, originally called centigrade, was developed by Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius in 1742. It is part of the metric system and is the standard temperature scale used in scientific research and weather reporting in most countries. The scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, making it intuitive for everyday use. In atmospheric science, Celsius is used to measure air temperature, dew point, and other thermal properties. The scale relates to the Kelvin scale (the SI base unit for temperature) by the simple conversion: °K = °C + 273.15.

                        The term "centigrade" was used for the temperature scale from its creation in 1742 until 1948, when it was officially renamed "Celsius" to honor Anders Celsius and avoid confusion with the angular measurement also called centigrade. The name centigrade literally means "hundred grades" or "hundred steps," reflecting the 100-degree span between water's freezing and boiling points. While the official name is now Celsius, the term centigrade is still occasionally used, particularly in older scientific literature and some informal contexts.

                        Chandrasekhar's most famous discovery was the theoretical limit for the mass of white dwarf stars, now known as the Chandrasekhar limit (approximately 1.44 solar masses). He showed that white dwarfs above this mass cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse, leading to either neutron stars or black holes. His work laid the foundation for understanding stellar evolution and the final stages of stellar life. Chandrasekhar was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with William Fowler, for his theoretical studies of the physical processes important to the structure and evolution of stars. The Chandra X-ray Observatory is named in his honor.

                        Named after Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, this limit represents a fundamental threshold in stellar evolution. When a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star and exceeds this mass limit, electron degeneracy pressure can no longer support the star against gravitational collapse. The resulting thermonuclear explosion completely destroys the white dwarf, creating a Type Ia supernova that serves as a "standard candle" for measuring cosmic distances and studying the expansion of the universe.

                        Climate change refers to significant changes in Earth's climate system over extended periods, with current changes largely driven by human activities that increase atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and associated effects including rising sea levels, changing precipitation patterns, more frequent extreme weather events, and shifts in ecosystems. Climate change is studied through multiple lines of evidence including temperature records, ice core data, satellite observations, and climate models. Understanding atmospheric processes is crucial for predicting future climate scenarios and developing mitigation strategies.

                        Clouds play a crucial role in Earth's weather and climate system, affecting both incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation. They form through various processes including convection, orographic lifting, and frontal systems. Clouds are classified by altitude (high, middle, low) and appearance (cumulus, stratus, cirrus), with each type indicating different atmospheric conditions. In climate science, clouds represent one of the most complex feedback mechanisms - they can both cool the planet by reflecting sunlight and warm it by trapping heat. Cloud formation requires water vapor, condensation nuclei (tiny particles), and cooling mechanisms that bring air to saturation.

                        Condensation is a fundamental process in the water cycle and atmospheric science, responsible for cloud formation, precipitation, and dew formation. It occurs when air containing water vapor is cooled to its saturation point, either through radiative cooling, adiabatic expansion during rising motion, or contact with cooler surfaces. The process requires condensation nuclei - tiny particles such as dust, sand, or bacteria - around which water droplets can form. Condensation releases latent heat, which can fuel further atmospheric processes like thunderstorm development. Understanding condensation is essential for weather prediction and climate modeling.

                        Conjunctions occur when celestial objects have similar celestial coordinates as seen from Earth, making them appear close together even though they may be vastly different distances away. Specifically, for the Solar System, a conjunction occurs when a superior planet (like Mars or Jupiter) passes behind the Sun from Earth's perspective, making it temporarily invisible. In contrast, an inferior conjunction happens when an inferior planet (Venus or Mercury) passes between Earth and the Sun, and a superior conjunction occurs when an inferior planet travels behind the Sun from Earth's perspective.

                        Convection cells are fundamental to atmospheric circulation and weather patterns. They form when surface heating creates temperature differences that drive vertical air motion. Warm, less dense air rises while cooler, denser air sinks, creating a circulation loop. These cells occur at various scales, from small thermal updrafts that create cumulus clouds to large-scale Hadley cells that drive global circulation patterns. In the tropics, Hadley cells transport heat from the equator toward the poles, while smaller convection cells are responsible for thunderstorm development and local weather patterns. Understanding convection cells is essential for weather prediction and climate modeling.

                        Conversion factors are essential tools in scientific calculations, allowing scientists to work within a measurement system, or between two measurement systems. For example, to convert from inches to centimeters, we use the conversion factor 2.54 cm/1 inch. The key principle is that conversion factors must equal 1 when the numerator and denominator represent the same physical quantity. Common conversion factors include length (1 meter = 39.37 inches), mass (1 kilogram = 2.205 pounds mass), and energy (1 joule = 0.239 calories). Proper use of conversion factors ensures dimensional consistency in calculations.

                        The Coriolis effect is fundamental to understanding atmospheric circulation, ocean currents, and weather patterns. It causes moving air masses to curve rather than travel in straight lines, leading to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones. In the Northern Hemisphere, low-pressure systems rotate counterclockwise while high-pressure systems rotate clockwise, with the opposite occurring in the Southern Hemisphere. The effect is strongest at the poles and weakest at the equator, where it becomes zero. The Coriolis effect is responsible for the trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies that drive global atmospheric circulation patterns. It also influences ocean currents and is crucial for understanding large-scale weather systems like hurricanes and typhoons.

Each "rung" of the ladder must be carefully calibrated using the previous rung, making the entire system interdependent. This systematic approach allows astronomers to measure distances across the observable universe, from nearby stars to galaxies billions of light-years away, and is fundamental to our understanding of cosmic expansion and the scale of the universe.

                        Cumulonimbus clouds are the most dramatic and powerful cloud type, often called "thunderheads" due to their association with thunderstorms. They form through strong convective processes when warm, moist air rises rapidly through the atmosphere, creating towering structures that can reach heights of 12-18 km (40,000-60,000 feet). The characteristic anvil shape at the top forms when the rising air hits the tropopause and spreads horizontally. These clouds produce lightning, thunder, heavy precipitation, hail, tornadoes, and strong winds. They are classified as vertical development clouds and represent some of the most energetic atmospheric phenomena, with updrafts that can exceed 30 m/s (100 ft/s).
