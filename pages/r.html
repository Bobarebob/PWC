                    <h2>Rain</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Liquid precipitation that forms when water droplets in clouds grow large enough through condensation and coalescence processes to fall to Earth's surface under the influence of gravity.

                        Rain is a crucial component of the water cycle, beginning when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses around microscopic particles called condensation nuclei to form tiny cloud droplets. These droplets grow through continued condensation and by colliding and merging with other droplets in a process called coalescence. When droplets reach sufficient size (typically 0.02 inches or 0.5 mm in diameter), they overcome air resistance and fall as raindrops. Rain formation requires specific atmospheric conditions including adequate moisture, lifting mechanisms to cool air to its dew point, and condensation nuclei. Different types of rain include convective rain from thunderstorms, orographic rain from air masses rising over mountains, and frontal rain from weather fronts. Rain is essential for replenishing freshwater resources, supporting ecosystems, and maintaining the global water balance.

                        Light rays are a fundamental concept in geometric optics, representing the path that light takes as it travels through space. While light actually behaves as both a wave and a particle, the ray model provides a simplified but powerful way to understand and predict optical phenomena like reflection, refraction, and image formation. Rays are always drawn perpendicular to wavefronts and indicate the direction of energy flow. In homogeneous media, light rays travel in straight lines, but they bend when passing between materials with different refractive indices. The ray model is essential for designing optical instruments like telescopes, microscopes, cameras, and eyeglasses. It also explains everyday phenomena such as shadows, mirrors, and the apparent bending of objects in water. Understanding light rays is crucial for fields ranging from photography and cinematography to laser technology and fiber optics.

                        Red sprites are part of a family of upper-atmospheric lightning phenomena called Transient Luminous Events (TLEs), which also includes blue jets and elves. Sprites appear as red or orange flashes that can extend from 50 to 90 kilometers altitude, making them much larger than regular lightning. They last only a few milliseconds and are triggered by powerful positive lightning strikes in the thunderstorm below. Sprites were first captured on video in 1989 and are difficult to observe from the ground because they occur above the clouds and are very brief. They play a role in the global electrical circuit and may affect the chemistry of the upper atmosphere. The red color comes from excited nitrogen molecules at the low air densities found at those altitudes.

                        Red supergiants are evolved massive stars (typically 8-40 times the mass of the Sun) that have exhausted the hydrogen in their cores and expanded to enormous sizes. Despite their cool surface temperatures (around 3,000-4,500 K), they are extremely luminous due to their vast surface area. Famous examples include Betelgeuse in Orion and Antares in Scorpius. These stars are in the final stages of their lives and will eventually explode as supernovae, potentially leaving behind neutron stars or black holes. Their red color comes from their relatively cool surface temperature compared to other types of stars.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The fundamental principle stating that when a light ray strikes a surface, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, with both angles measured with respect to the normal (perpendicular) to the surface.

                    <div class="context">
                        The law of reflection is one of the most fundamental principles in optics, governing how light behaves when it encounters surfaces. This law applies to all types of light, not just visible light, and forms the basis for understanding mirrors, periscopes, and many optical instruments. The law works for both specular reflection (from smooth surfaces like mirrors) and diffuse reflection (from rough surfaces). When parallel light rays hit a smooth surface, all the rays reflect at the same angle, creating clear images. When however parallel light rays hit a rough surface, with different parts of the surface having different orientations, the light rays necessarily reflect in different directions, creating diffuse illumination. The law of reflection, combined with Snell's law of refraction, describes most geometric optics phenomena. Understanding reflection is essential for designing optical systems, explaining natural phenomena like rainbows and mirages, and developing technologies from telescopes to fiber optics.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The bending of light rays when they pass from one transparent medium to another with a different refractive index, caused by the change in light's speed as it enters the new medium.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Refraction occurs because light travels at different speeds in different materials - faster in less dense media like air, and slower in denser media like water or glass. When light enters a new medium at an angle, one part of the wavefront enters first and slows down (or speeds up), causing the entire wave to bend. This phenomenon is governed by Snell's law, which relates the angles and refractive indices of the two media. Refraction explains many everyday observations: why objects appear bent when partially submerged in water, how lenses focus light to form images, and why the Sun appears flattened near the horizon. It's the fundamental principle behind eyeglasses, contact lenses, cameras, telescopes, microscopes, and fiber optic communications. Atmospheric refraction causes mirages and loomings, and affects astronomical observations. Understanding refraction is essential for designing optical instruments and explaining natural phenomena involving light propagation through different media.

                        Relative humidity is a crucial meteorological parameter that affects human comfort, weather patterns, and many atmospheric processes. It varies with temperature - warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air, so relative humidity changes even if the actual amount of water vapor remains constant. At 100% relative humidity, the air is saturated and cannot hold any more water vapor, leading to condensation and the formation of dew, fog, or clouds. Relative humidity affects the rate of evaporation, the formation of precipitation, and human perception of temperature (heat index). It's measured using instruments like psychrometers, hygrometers, or electronic sensors. Understanding relative humidity is essential for weather forecasting, agriculture, indoor air quality management, and many industrial processes.

                        Rod cells are one of two types of photoreceptors in the human retina, along with cone cells. There are approximately 120 million rod cells in each human eye, far outnumbering the 6 million cone cells. Rods contain the photopigment rhodopsin, which is extremely sensitive to light and allows vision in dim conditions - up to 1000 times more sensitive than cones. However, rods cannot distinguish colors and provide only black-and-white vision. They are concentrated in the peripheral areas of the retina, which is why peripheral vision is better in low light. Rods are responsible for night vision and detecting motion in low-light environments. When you enter a dark room, it takes time for rods to regenerate rhodopsin and adapt to the darkness - a process called dark adaptation. Understanding rod function is crucial for studying vision disorders, designing lighting systems, and developing treatments for night blindness and other visual impairments.

                        Vera Rubin (1928-2016) discovered that stars in the outer regions of galaxies were moving faster than expected based on visible matter alone. Her work in the 1970s showed that galaxies must contain much more mass than we can see, leading to the modern understanding of dark matter. She was a pioneer for women in astronomy.
