                        The second-largest moon of Jupiter and the third-largest moon in the Solar System, believed to harbor a subsurface liquid ocean beneath its icy crust.

                        Callisto is considered one of the most promising targets for astrobiology research due to its subsurface ocean, which may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. The moon's relatively stable environment and distance from Jupiter's intense radiation make it an attractive target for future exploration missions. Unlike Europa, Callisto's ocean is likely separated from its rocky core by a layer of ice, but it still represents a potentially habitable environment.

                        The Cambrian Explosion represents one of the most significant events in Earth's biological history and is considered crucial to the development of complex life. This event is often cited in discussions of the Rare Earth Hypothesis as an example of the unlikely circumstances that led to complex life on Earth. During this period, organisms developed hard shells, complex eyes, and sophisticated body plans that form the basis of modern animal diversity.

                        A period of extremely rapid exponential expansion of the universe that occurred in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang, during which the observable universe grew from subatomic to macroscopic size.

                        Cosmic inflation lasted less than a trillionth of a second but expanded the observable universe by about 26 orders of magnitude - from the size of a proton to the size of a grapefruit. This process explains the remarkable uniformity of the cosmic microwave background. Inflation theory explains several key features of our universe, including its flatness, uniformity, and the origin of the density fluctuations that eventually became galaxies and stars.

                        The CMB was released during the recombination epoch when the universe cooled enough for electrons and protons to form neutral hydrogen atoms, making the universe transparent to light for the first time. Originally at 3000 Kelvin, this radiation has been redshifted to 2.73 Kelvin today. The CMB provides crucial evidence for the Big Bang theory and allows scientists to study the early universe's conditions and composition with extraordinary precision.

                        A term in Einstein's field equations representing the energy density of empty space, originally introduced to allow for a static universe but now associated with dark energy.

                    <div class="context">
                        Einstein initially added the cosmological constant (Î›) to his equations to prevent the universe from expanding or contracting. After Hubble's discovery of cosmic expansion, Einstein called it his "greatest mistake." However, the discovery of accelerating expansion has revived interest in this concept. The cosmological constant is now the leading explanation for dark energy, the mysterious force driving the universe's accelerating expansion.

                        The stretching of light wavelengths due to the expansion of space itself, causing distant objects to appear redder than they actually are.

                    <div class="context">
                        As the universe expands, the space between galaxies stretches, and light traveling through this space gets stretched as well. This is different from Doppler redshift, which is caused by motion through space rather than the expansion of space itself. Cosmological redshift is a key tool for measuring distances to far galaxies and studying the expansion history of the universe.

After this point, dark energy became the dominant force, causing the expansion to accelerate. This transition fundamentally changed the universe's fate from potential collapse to eternal expansion.
