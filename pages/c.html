                        The second-largest moon of Jupiter and the third-largest moon in the Solar System, believed to harbor a subsurface liquid ocean beneath its icy crust.

                        Callisto is considered one of the most promising targets for astrobiology research due to its subsurface ocean, which may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. The moon's relatively stable environment and distance from Jupiter's intense radiation make it an attractive target for future exploration missions. Unlike Europa, Callisto's ocean is likely separated from its rocky core by a layer of ice, but it still represents a potentially habitable environment.

                        Cardinal West is one of the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) that form the foundation of navigation and orientation systems. West is defined as the direction toward which the Sun appears to set during the spring and fall equinoxes. On a standard compass, west is located at 270 degrees, directly opposite to east (90 degrees). The cardinal directions are fundamental to map reading, navigation, and geographic coordinate systems used worldwide.

While less common today, CGS units are still used in some specialized fields, particularly in theoretical physics and chemistry, where the smaller base units can be more convenient for calculations involving atomic and molecular scales.

                    <div class="definition">
                        Indian-American astrophysicist (1910-1995) who made fundamental contributions to our understanding of stellar structure and evolution, particularly the physics of white dwarf stars.

                    <div class="context">
                        Chandrasekhar's most famous discovery was the theoretical limit for the mass of white dwarf stars, now known as the Chandrasekhar limit (approximately 1.44 solar masses). He showed that white dwarfs above this mass cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse, leading to either neutron stars or black holes. His work laid the foundation for understanding stellar evolution and the final stages of stellar life. Chandrasekhar was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with William Fowler, for his theoretical studies of the physical processes important to the structure and evolution of stars. The Chandra X-ray Observatory is named in his honor.

                        Named after Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, this limit represents a fundamental threshold in stellar evolution. When a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star and exceeds this mass limit, electron degeneracy pressure can no longer support the star against gravitational collapse. The resulting thermonuclear explosion completely destroys the white dwarf, creating a Type Ia supernova that serves as a "standard candle" for measuring cosmic distances and studying the expansion of the universe.

In contrast, an inferior conjunction happens when an inferior planet (Venus or Mercury) passes between Earth and the Sun, and a superior conjunction occurs when an inferior planet travels behind the Sun from Earth's perspective.

For example, to convert from inches to centimeters, we use the conversion factor 2.54 cm/1 inch. The key principle is that conversion factors must equal 1 when the numerator and denominator represent the same physical quantity. Common conversion factors include length (1 meter = 39.37 inches), mass (1 kilogram = 2.205 pounds mass), and energy (1 joule = 0.239 calories). Proper use of conversion factors ensures dimensional consistency in calculations.

Each "rung" of the ladder must be carefully calibrated using the previous rung, making the entire system interdependent. This systematic approach allows astronomers to measure distances across the observable universe, from nearby stars to galaxies billions of light-years away, and is fundamental to our understanding of cosmic expansion and the scale of the universe.

Originally at 3000 Kelvin, this radiation has been redshifted to 2.73 Kelvin today. The CMB provides crucial evidence for the Big Bang theory and allows scientists to study the early universe's conditions and composition with extraordinary precision.

                        A term in Einstein's field equations representing the energy density of empty space, originally introduced to allow for a static universe but now associated with dark energy.

                    <div class="context">
                        Einstein initially added the cosmological constant (Î) to his equations to prevent the universe from expanding or contracting. After Hubble's discovery of cosmic expansion, Einstein called it his "greatest mistake." However, the discovery of accelerating expansion has revived interest in this concept. The cosmological constant is now the leading explanation for dark energy, the mysterious force driving the universe's accelerating expansion.

                        The stretching of light wavelengths due to the expansion of space itself, causing distant objects to appear redder than they actually are.

                    <div class="context">
                        As the universe expands, the space between galaxies stretches, and light traveling through this space gets stretched as well. This is different from Doppler redshift, which is caused by motion through space rather than the expansion of space itself. Cosmological redshift is a key tool for measuring distances to far galaxies and studying the expansion history of the universe.

                        The moment in cosmic history when dark energy began to dominate over matter in driving the universe's expansion, occurring approximately 5 billion years ago.

                        Before the crossover point, matter (both ordinary and dark) dominated the universe's dynamics, causing expansion to decelerate. After this point, dark energy became the dominant force, causing the expansion to accelerate. This transition fundamentally changed the universe's fate from potential collapse to eternal expansion.
