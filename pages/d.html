                    <div class="definition">
                        A mysterious form of energy that permeates all of space and causes the accelerating expansion of the universe, comprising approximately 71.4% of the total universe.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Dark energy was discovered in 1998 through observations of distant Type Ia supernovae. Unlike matter, which becomes less dense as the universe expands, dark energy appears to maintain constant density or even increase as space expands. Dark energy is one of the greatest mysteries in modern physics, fundamentally challenging our understanding of space, time, and the ultimate fate of the universe.

                        Dawn occurs when the Sun is still below the horizon but its light begins to illuminate the sky through atmospheric scattering. There are three types of dawn: astronomical dawn (Sun 18° below horizon), nautical dawn (Sun 12° below horizon), and civil dawn (Sun 6° below horizon). Civil dawn is when there is enough light for most outdoor activities without artificial lighting. Dawn is the counterpart to dusk, which occurs in the evening after sunset.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The practice of advancing clocks by one hour during warmer months to make better use of longer daylight hours, so that darkness falls at a later clock time.

                    <div class="context">
                        Daylight Saving Time (DST) is observed in many countries to maximize the use of natural daylight during evening hours. In the United States, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. The practice was first widely implemented during World War I to conserve energy. While the energy savings are now minimal, DST continues in many regions, though its benefits and drawbacks remain subjects of ongoing debate.

                        Dark matter doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it detectable only through its gravitational effects. Without dark matter, galaxies would fly apart during rotation, and the large-scale structure of the universe couldn't have formed. Dark matter is essential for explaining galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the formation of cosmic structure, yet its fundamental nature remains unknown.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The temperature at which air becomes saturated with water vapor and condensation begins to form, representing the point where relative humidity reaches 100%.

                    <div class="context">
                        Dew point temperature is a fundamental concept in atmospheric science and meteorology, providing a direct measure of atmospheric moisture content. Unlike relative humidity, which depends on both moisture and temperature, dew point gives an absolute measure of water vapor in the air. When air temperature equals the dew point, the air is saturated and condensation occurs, forming dew, fog, or clouds. Higher dew points indicate more moisture in the atmosphere and often correlate with uncomfortable, humid conditions. Dew point is crucial for weather forecasting, as it helps predict fog formation, precipitation likelihood, and comfort levels. In aviation, dew point spread (the difference between temperature and dew point) is used to assess visibility conditions.

                    <div class="context">
                        Digital calipers are essentially "glorified rulers" that can measure to 0.01 mm precision - about one-tenth the thickness of a single sheet of paper. They can make external measurements (like the length of a metal block), internal measurements (like the diameter of a cylindrical hole), and depth measurements using the depth probe. The tolerance for digital calipers is typically 100% of the least count (0.01 mm), so measurements are written as 12.34 ± 0.01 mm.

                        Phobos is the larger and closer moon, orbiting Mars in just 7.6 hours at a distance of only 6,000 km above the surface. It is so close that it orbits faster than Mars rotates, causing it to rise in the west and set in the east as seen from Mars. Deimos is smaller and more distant, orbiting in 30.3 hours at about 20,000 km altitude. Both moons are thought to be captured asteroids due to their irregular shapes and composition. Phobos is gradually spiraling inward and will either crash into Mars or break apart into a ring system in about 50 million years. These "asteroid moons" are much smaller than Earth's Moon, with Phobos being about 22 km across and Deimos only 12 km across.

                        Digital devices differ from analog devices in that they display discrete numerical values rather than continuous scales. The last digit to the right - the one that changes by the smallest amount - is called the least significant digit. For digital devices, the tolerance or instrument limiting error is typically chosen as 100% of the least count because of repeatability variations and digit "flickering" during measurement.

Astronomical dusk represents true nightfall, when the sky becomes completely dark and astronomical observations can begin. Dusk is the evening counterpart to dawn.
