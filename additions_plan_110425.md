# PWC Website Additions Plan - Revision 110425

## Overview
Adding 14 new optical and light physics terms to the PWC website with precise alphabetization and carefully vetted links. All Khan Academy links have been removed as requested.

## New Terms to Add

### P Page (1 term - Note: Duplicate entry issue)
- **Principle of Superposition** → immediately after Principle of Superposition

### R Page (3 terms)
- **Rays (Light)** → immediately after Rare Earth Hypothesis
- **Refraction** → immediately after Reflection  
- **Rods (Eyesight)** → immediately after Adam Riess

### S Page (4 terms)
- **Snell's Law of Refraction** → immediately after Small Magellanic Cloud
- **Spatial Coherence (Light)** → immediately after Solar Wind
- **Specular Reflection** → immediately after Solar System
- **Speed of Light** → immediately before Standard Notation

### T Page (4 terms)
- **Temporal Coherence (Light)** → immediately after Temperature of the Universe
- **Total Internal Reflection** → immediately after Tolerance or Instrument Limiting Error
- **Transmission (Light)** → immediately before Translucence (Light)
- **Transparency (Light)** → immediately after Transmission (Light)
- **Translucence (Light)** → immediately after Transit of Venus

### W Page (1 term)
- **Waves** → immediately after Water Vapor

## Content Sources
- Module 6A: The Nature of Light (primary reference)
- Wikipedia (required for all terms)
- Carefully vetted additional links that directly define terms
- No Khan Academy links (all removed as requested)

## Link Vetting Strategy
1. Test all links for 404 errors before inclusion
2. Ensure additional links go directly to pages defining the specific term
3. Prioritize authoritative sources: NIST, NASA, Britannica, educational institutions
4. Avoid generic or tangentially related links

## Quality Standards
- Comprehensive definitions based on Module 6A
- Professional educational tone consistent with existing content
- Detailed context explaining practical applications
- Perfect alphabetical positioning as specified
- HTML structure and styling consistency maintained
