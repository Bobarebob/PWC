                    <h2>General Theory of Relativity</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Einstein's theory of gravitation that describes gravity not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Published in 1915, General Relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. The theory predicts phenomena like gravitational time dilation, black holes, and gravitational waves, all of which have been observationally confirmed. General Relativity is essential for modern cosmology, GPS satellites, and our understanding of the universe's evolution from the Big Bang to its ultimate fate.

                    <div class="definition">
                        Ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by accelerating masses, traveling at the speed of light and predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.

                    <div class="context">
                        Gravitational waves were first directly detected by LIGO in 2015, confirming Einstein's century-old prediction. They are produced by violent cosmic events such as merging black holes or neutron stars. The detection opened a new window for observing the universe and earned the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A proposed solution to Fermi's Paradox suggesting that there is at least one evolutionary step that is extremely unlikely or impossible for life to overcome, preventing the emergence of widespread intelligent civilizations.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The Great Filter could be in our past (explaining why we don't see other civilizations) or in our future (suggesting that civilizations tend to destroy themselves before achieving interstellar communication). Examples include the emergence of life itself, the development of complex cells, or the tendency for advanced civilizations to self-destruct through war, environmental destruction, or other catastrophes.
