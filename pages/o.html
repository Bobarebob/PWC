                    <div class="definition">
                        An advisory principle stating that whenever there are two competing hypotheses, chances are the simpler of the two is the correct one.

                    <div class="context">
                        Occam's Principle never claims that the simpler of two competing hypotheses is always the correct one, only that the simpler hypothesis is likely to be the correct one. Both hypotheses could be wrong, or the less simple hypothesis could be correct. However, if you are looking for guidance on which hypothesis to explore in depth first, Occam suggests examining the simpler one first. This principle was demonstrated in the comparison between the geocentric and heliocentric models of the solar system, where the much simpler heliocentric model proved to be correct.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The largest planetary volcano in the Solar System, located on Mars and standing 72,000 feet tall - two and a half times taller than Mount Everest on Earth.

                    <div class="context">
                        Olympus Mons is a shield volcano that formed over millions of years through repeated lava flows. Its enormous size is possible on Mars due to the planet's lower gravity (about 38% of Earth's) and lack of plate tectonics, which allowed the volcano to remain stationary over its magma source and grow to unprecedented heights. The volcano has a base diameter of about 370 miles (600 km), roughly the size of the state of Arizona. While there may be some residual volcanic activity on Mars, Olympus Mons is considered dormant. The volcano's slopes are relatively gentle, with an average grade of only 5 degrees, making it more like a massive dome than a steep mountain.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A method for determining tolerance in analog measuring devices by taking the tolerance to be half of the least count.

                    <div class="context">
                        For analog devices, we use the one-half rule because we can conservatively say that we can "see" 2 parts in the least count. This means we can determine with 100% confidence that the center line of the sleeve is either exactly on a marking on the thimble, or somewhere between two adjacent markings. By adding and subtracting half the least count, we create a least count-sized "window" around our best guess. For example, a micrometer measurement would be written as 15.500 Â± 0.005 mm.

                    <h2>Orion the Hunter</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        One of the most recognizable constellations in the night sky, representing a hunter in Greek mythology and containing many bright stars and notable deep-sky objects.

                    <div class="context">
                        Orion is visible worldwide and serves as a guide to finding other constellations and celestial objects. The constellation features the distinctive three-star belt (Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka), bright stars like Betelgeuse (red supergiant) and Rigel (blue supergiant), and the famous Orion Nebula. In mythology, Orion was a great hunter, and the constellation's pattern resembles a human figure with a belt, sword, and raised arm. Orion is best visible during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere.

                        A prominent asterism consisting of three bright stars (Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka) that form a distinctive line in the constellation Orion.

                    <div class="context">
                        Orion's Belt is one of the most recognizable star patterns in the night sky and serves as an excellent guide for locating other celestial objects. The three stars are approximately aligned and appear to form the belt of the mythological hunter Orion. This asterism points toward Sirius (the brightest star in the night sky) when extended to the southeast, and toward Aldebaran in Taurus when extended to the northwest. The belt stars are all hot, blue supergiants located at different distances from Earth, ranging from about 800 to 2,000 light-years away.

                        An asterism also known as Orion's Sword, consisting of three stars and the Orion Nebula hanging from Orion's Belt, resembling a sword or its scabbard.

                    <div class="context">
                        Orion's Scabbard (or Orion's Sword) comprises three stars (42 Orionis, Theta Orionis, and Iota Orionis) and the famous Orion Nebula (M42). The middle "star" that appears to the naked eye is actually the Orion Nebula, one of the brightest nebulae visible from Earth and a stellar nursery where new stars are being born. This asterism hangs below Orion's Belt and completes the visual representation of the mythological hunter with his weapon. The Orion Nebula within the scabbard is a popular target for both amateur and professional astronomers.
