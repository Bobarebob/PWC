                        The hypothesis that life exists throughout the universe and is distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, comets, and planetoids, potentially seeding life on Earth from space.

                        While not widely accepted by the scientific community, panspermia offers an alternative explanation for the origin of life on Earth. The discovery of extremophiles that can survive in space-like conditions has lent some credibility to the possibility of life traveling between worlds. Some scientists propose that life could spread throughout the galaxy via natural processes or even deliberate seeding by advanced civilizations.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The apparent displacement of an object caused by a change in observational position, which can introduce measurement errors if not properly accounted for.

                    <div class="context">
                        In scientific measurements, parallax error occurs when you don't view the measurement scale straight on. For example, when reading a graduated cylinder, you must view the water level at water level height to avoid parallax error. If you look from above or below, the apparent position of the meniscus will shift, leading to inaccurate readings. Proper measurement technique requires eliminating parallax by positioning your eye or eyes at the same level or position as the measurement being taken.

                        A unit of length used to measure astronomical distances, defined as the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond, equal to approximately 3.26 light-years.

                        The parsec (symbol: pc) is the preferred unit for measuring distances to stars and galaxies in professional astronomy. It is derived from stellar parallax measurements - if a star shows a parallax of one arcsecond when observed from opposite sides of Earth's orbit, it is exactly one parsec away. One parsec equals about 206,265 astronomical units or 30.9 trillion kilometers. Larger distances are often expressed in kiloparsecs (kpc) for galactic scales or megaparsecs (Mpc) for intergalactic distances. The parsec provides a direct connection between observable parallax angles and actual distances.

                        The particle model of light, championed by Newton and later refined by Einstein, describes light as composed of discrete energy packets called photons. This particle nature explains phenomena like the photoelectric effect, where light ejects electrons from materials, and Compton scattering, where photons collide with electrons like billiard balls. The particle model successfully explains how light interacts with matter at the quantum level and why light energy comes in discrete amounts proportional to frequency (E = hf). However, light also exhibits wave properties like interference and diffraction, leading to the modern understanding of wave-particle duality. All matter and energy exhibit both particle and wave characteristics depending on the experimental context. Understanding particles is fundamental to quantum mechanics, atomic physics, and modern technology including lasers, solar cells, and medical imaging devices.

                        A historical approach to understanding light that treats it as waves propagating through a medium (or later, the vacuum of space), forming the foundation of wave optics and explaining interference and diffraction phenomena.

                    <div class="context">
                        The  school of light, championed by Christiaan Huygens and later Thomas Young, viewed light as waves similar to sound or water waves. This approach successfully explained phenomena that the geometric (particle) model could not, including interference patterns, diffraction around obstacles, and the wave nature of light propagation. Young's double-slit experiment demonstrated that light creates interference patterns characteristic of waves, while Huygens' principle explained how waves propagate and bend around corners. The wave model also explained polarization, where light waves oscillate in specific orientations. However, this model couldn't explain phenomena like the photoelectric effect, which requires the particle nature of light. Modern physics recognizes that light exhibits both wave and particle properties (wave-particle duality) depending on the experimental context. The physical school's wave insights remain fundamental to understanding optics, electromagnetic radiation, and quantum mechanics.

                        Precipitation forms when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses around tiny particles called condensation nuclei and grows large enough to fall under gravity. The type of precipitation depends on atmospheric temperature profiles - rain forms when temperatures are above freezing at the rain's condensation altitude, snow forms when temperatures are below freezing at the snow's condensation altitude, and sleet (freezing rain) occurs when there are mixed temperature layers during the water's descent. Precipitation is essential for replenishing freshwater supplies, supporting ecosystems, and driving the global water cycle. Accurate precipitation forecasting is crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and flood prediction. Climate change is altering precipitation patterns worldwide, with some regions experiencing more intense rainfall events while others face increased drought conditions.

High precision means measurements are consistent, reproducible and close to each other, even if they might all be systematically off from the true value.

                        Atmospheric pressure is a fundamental meteorological parameter that varies with altitude, weather systems, and temperature. At sea level, standard atmospheric pressure is 1013.25 millibars (or hectopascals), or 14.7 pounds per square inch. Pressure decreases exponentially with altitude - roughly halving every 5.5 kilometers - which is why aircraft cabins must be pressurized. Weather systems are characterized by areas of high and low pressure: high-pressure systems typically bring clear, stable weather, while low-pressure systems are associated with clouds, precipitation, and storms. Barometric pressure changes can be used to forecast weather, as falling pressure often indicates approaching storms, while rising pressure suggests improving conditions. The measurement of atmospheric pressure is crucial for aviation, weather forecasting, and understanding atmospheric dynamics.

                    <h2>Primary Colors</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The fundamental colors that cannot be created by mixing other colors together, serving as the basis for creating all other colors in a given color system.

                        In additive color systems (like light), the primary colors are red, green, and blue (RGB), which correspond to the peak sensitivities of the three types of cone cells in human vision. When these colored lights are combined in various intensities, they can produce the full spectrum of visible colors, including white light when all three are combined equally. In subtractive color systems (like pigments and paints), the primary colors are typically cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY), which absorb specific wavelengths of light rather than emitting them. The concept of primary colors is fundamental to understanding human color perception, display technology, printing, and artistic color theory. Different species may have different primary colors based on their visual systems - for example, many birds and insects can see ultraviolet light and have four or more types of color receptors. Understanding primary colors is essential for fields ranging from digital displays and photography to neuroscience and evolutionary biology.

                    <h2>Principle of Falsifiability</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        An advisory principle first espoused by Karl Popper stating that in order for a hypothesis to be considered scientific, it must be possible to show it is false, if in fact it is false.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        This principle distinguishes science from pseudoscience. Anyone can make a conjecture about the objective world, but if the statement can never be tested by experiment, it is not scientific and cannot be part of the scientific canon. The Principle of Falsifiability is particularly important today because individuals sometimes make statements they claim are scientific, but are in fact untestable. If a conjecture cannot be shown to be false through experimentation, it falls outside the realm of science.

                        Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris) is a binary star system located about 11.5 light-years from Earth, making it one of our nearest stellar neighbors. The primary star is a yellow-white subgiant that has evolved beyond the main sequence. Procyon, along with Sirius and Betelgeuse, forms the prominent Winter Triangle asterism that dominates northern winter skies. In mythology, Canis Minor represents the smaller of Orion the Hunter's two dogs, with Procyon marking the body of this celestial canine.

                        Proxima Centauri b, discovered in 2016, orbits within the star's habitable zone and has been the target of SETI observations. The system represents the nearest possible destination for interstellar travel and communication attempts. Recent studies suggest the planet may have conditions suitable for liquid water, though it likely faces challenges from stellar radiation.
