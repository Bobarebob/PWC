                    <h2>Fall Equinox Day</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The calendar day on which the autumnal equinox occurs, typically September 22 or 23 in the Northern Hemisphere, marking the first day of astronomical fall.

                    <div class="context">
                        The Fall Equinox Day varies slightly from year to year due to the Earth's orbital mechanics and the calendar system. On this day, the Sun crosses the celestial equator moving southward, resulting in approximately equal hours of daylight and darkness worldwide. This day marks the transition from summer to autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and from winter to spring in the Southern Hemisphere.

                        Unlike the Fall Equinox Day, which refers to the entire calendar day, the Fall Equinox Moment is the exact astronomical event when the Sun's center crosses the celestial equator. This moment occurs at the same instant worldwide but corresponds to different local times depending on time zone. Astronomical calculations can predict this moment years in advance with great precision.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The astronomical event when the Sun appears to cross the celestial equator heading southward, resulting in approximately equal day and night lengths worldwide.

                        The Fall or Autumnal Equinox occurs around September 22-23 each year and marks the official beginning of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and spring in the Southern Hemisphere. During the equinox, the Sun rises due east and sets due west everywhere on Earth. The word "equinox" comes from Latin meaning "equal night," referring to the nearly equal duration of day and night. This event is one of only two times per year when the Earth's axis is tilted neither toward nor away from the Sun.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The hemisphere of the Moon that is permanently turned away from Earth due to tidal locking, often incorrectly called the "dark side" of the Moon.

                    <div class="context">
                        The far side of the Moon is not permanently dark - it receives sunlight just like the near side, but we cannot see it from Earth because the Moon is tidally locked to our planet. The Moon rotates on its axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit Earth (about 27.3 days), so the same side always faces us. The far side was first photographed by the Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft in 1959 and first visited by humans during the Apollo 8 mission in 1968. It has a different appearance from the near side, with more craters and fewer large dark plains (maria), likely because it lacks the gravitational influence of Earth that helped create the smoother near side features.

                        In 1950, during a casual lunch conversation at Los Alamos, Fermi posed the famous question 'Where is everybody?' highlighting the apparent contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for their existence. This became known as Fermi's Paradox, one of the most important questions in astrobiology.

                        American theoretical physicist (1918-1988) and Nobel Prize laureate known for his work in quantum electrodynamics, his teaching ability, and his emphasis on the primacy of experimental evidence over theoretical expectations.

                        Feynman revolutionized physics with his path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and Feynman diagrams for visualizing particle interactions. He famously emphasized that "it doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong." This principle underlies the scientific method's requirement that all knowledge be verified through experiment, making Feynman a champion of empirical science over theoretical speculation.

                        During the First Quarter Moon, the Moon has completed one-quarter of its orbit around Earth since the new moon. The illuminated half appears on the right side when viewed from the Northern Hemisphere and on the left side when viewed from the Southern Hemisphere. The First Quarter Moon rises around noon and sets around midnight, making it visible in the afternoon and evening sky. This phase is often called a "half moon" due to its appearance, though astronomically it represents the first quarter of the lunar cycle.
