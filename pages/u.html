                    <h2>Unit</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The third part of a scientific measurement that specifies what physical quantity is being measured, such as centimeters for length or grams for mass.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        In a scientific measurement like 12.34 ± 0.02 cm, the unit (cm) tells us that we're measuring length in centimeters. Units are essential because they give meaning to the numerical values - without units, numbers are meaningless in scientific contexts. Common units include meters for distance, seconds for time, kilograms for mass, and Kelvin for temperature. The unit completes the three-part structure that makes a measurement scientifically meaningful and reproducible.

                        The observable universe is estimated to be about 93 billion light-years in diameter and contains over 2 trillion galaxies. It began with the Big Bang approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. The universe consists of about 5% ordinary matter, 27% dark matter, and 68% dark energy.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The rate at which the universe is expanding, measured by the Hubble constant, currently estimated at about 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec.

                    <div class="context">
                        The expansion rate determines how fast distant galaxies are moving away from us. This rate has changed over cosmic time - initially slowing due to gravity, then accelerating due to dark energy starting about 5 billion years ago. Precise measurements of this rate help determine the universe's age and fate.

                        The current average temperature of the universe is approximately 2.73 Kelvin (-270.42°C), as measured by the cosmic microwave background radiation.

                    <div class="context">
                        The universe has been cooling since the Big Bang as it expands. Initially infinitely hot, it cooled to about 3000 K when atoms first formed, and the radiation from that time has been redshifted to the current 2.73 K. This temperature will continue to decrease as the universe expands.

                    <h2>US-English Systems of Units</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The system of measurement units commonly used in the United States, also known as the US customary system, based on units like feet for length, pounds for mass (force), and degrees Fahrenheit for temperature.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The US-English system includes units such as inches, feet, yards, and miles for length; pounds and tons for mass (force); and degrees Fahrenheit for temperature. While most of the world uses the metric system, the United States continues to use this system for everyday measurements. In scientific contexts, conversion factors are essential for translating between US-English and metric units. For example, 1 inch exactly equals 2.54 centimeters, 1 pound equals 0.454 kilograms, and the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion requires the formula C = 5/9 x (F-32).
