                    <h2>Near Side (Moon)</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The hemisphere of the Moon that always faces Earth due to tidal locking, featuring the familiar patterns of dark plains (maria) and bright highlands visible to the naked eye.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The near side of the Moon is the only side visible from Earth because the Moon is tidally locked to our planet - it rotates on its axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit Earth (about 27.3 days). This side features the large dark areas called maria (Latin for "seas"), which are actually ancient lava plains, and the brighter highland regions covered with impact craters. The near side has a different appearance from the far side, with more maria and fewer large craters, likely due to the gravitational influence of Earth during the Moon's formation and early history. The patterns on the near side have inspired human imagination for millennia, with various cultures seeing different shapes like the "Man in the Moon" or the "Rabbit in the Moon."

                    <h2>Nebulae</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Clouds of gas and dust in space, visible either by emitting their own light or by reflecting or absorbing light from nearby stars, serving as stellar nurseries and stellar graveyards.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Nebulae come in several types: emission nebulae that glow from ionized gas heated by nearby hot stars, reflection nebulae that scatter light from nearby stars, dark nebulae that block background light, and planetary nebulae formed when dying stars expel their outer layers. Famous examples include the Orion Nebula (a stellar nursery), the Horsehead Nebula (a dark nebula), and the Ring Nebula (a planetary nebula). These cosmic clouds play crucial roles in the stellar lifecycle - they are where new stars are born from gravitational collapse and where dying stars return material to space for future star formation. The study of nebulae has been fundamental to understanding stellar evolution and the chemical enrichment of the universe.

                    <h2>Non-Trivial Systematic Error</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A systematic error that significantly affects measurement accuracy and cannot be easily corrected through simple zeroing or observationally corrective procedures.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Non-trivial systematic errors are defined as inherent limitations in the process or procedure of a scientific experiment. They are clearly more complex than trivial systematic errors and often require sophisticated corrective actions to the experiment. Examples of non-trivial systematic errors include temperature-dependent drift in electronic instruments, unexpected non-linear response characteristics in a measuring device, or systematic bias introduced by a measurement technique itself. Unlike trivial systematic errors (such as simple zero error), non-trivial systematic errors may vary with measurement conditions and require detailed analysis to identify and correct. These errors can significantly compromise the validity of scientific measurements if not properly addressed.

                    <h2>North Star (Polaris)</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The current pole star of the Northern Hemisphere, located nearly in line with Earth's rotational axis, making it appear stationary in the night sky while other stars rotate around it.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Polaris, also known as the North Star or Pole Star, is a yellow supergiant located about 433 light-years from Earth in the constellation Ursa Minor. Due to Earth's axial precession over a 26,000-year cycle, Polaris will not always be the pole star - around 3000 BCE, Thuban in Draco was the pole star, and around 12,000 CE, Vega will become the new pole star. Polaris has been crucial for navigation throughout human history, as it provides a reliable reference point for determining direction and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. The star appears to remain fixed while all other stars appear to rotate around it due to Earth's rotation, making it an invaluable celestial landmark for travelers and astronomers.
