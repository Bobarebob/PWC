                        Italian physicist and astronomer (1564-1642) who discovered that excluding aerodynamic factors, objects of dissimilar mass, released from the same height off the ground, will hit the ground at the same time.

                        Galileo's experimental approach revolutionized physics by demonstrating that experiment trumps common sense. His Law of Falling Bodies was counterintuitive - most people expect heavier objects to fall faster - but experiment revealed this to be false. Galileo famously demonstrated this principle by dropping objects from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. His work laid the foundation for the scientific method and modern physics, showing that physics is not a matter of "common sense" but of experimental verification.

                        This law is counterintuitive because common sense suggests that heavier objects should fall faster. However, experimental evidence consistently shows this is not true. The law was demonstrated dramatically on the Moon during Apollo 15, when Commander David Scott simultaneously dropped a hammer and a feather in the airless environment, and they hit the lunar surface at the same time. This principle illustrates that physics is based on experimental evidence rather than intuition.

                        Einstein's theory of gravitation that describes gravity not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

                        Published in 1915, General Relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. The theory predicts phenomena like gravitational time dilation, black holes, and gravitational waves, all of which have been observationally confirmed. General Relativity is essential for modern cosmology, GPS satellites, and our understanding of the universe's evolution from the Big Bang to its ultimate fate.

                        A model stating that the Earth is the center of the solar system, meaning that the Sun, in addition to the planets and the Moon, go around the Earth.

                    <div class="context">
                        To explain planetary retrograde motion using this model, it was necessary to have planets move on small circles called epicycles, whose centers moved on larger circles called deferents around Earth. This created a complex "corkscrew" motion that was truly Rube Goldbergesque, with no compelling explanation for why planets would move this way. The geocentric model was eventually replaced by the much simpler heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus, in accordance with Occam's Principle that the simpler of two competing hypotheses is likely to be correct.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.

                    <div class="context">
                        Global warming occurs through the enhanced greenhouse effect, where increased concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap more of the Sun's energy that would otherwise radiate back to space. Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have significantly increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, leading to a measurable warming trend. The scientific evidence for global warming includes rising global temperatures, melting ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels, and shifts in weather patterns. This warming affects atmospheric circulation patterns, precipitation distribution, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Understanding global warming is crucial for predicting future climate changes and developing strategies to mitigate its impacts on human societies and natural ecosystems.

                        Graduated cylinders present unique measurement challenges due to the meniscus effect - water creeps up the inside wall of the cylindrical glass tube, making a sort of half "U" shape. When using the top of the meniscus and viewing the water level straight on (at water level height to avoid parallax), you can actually see 5 parts in the least count, allowing for better precision than the simple 50% rule would suggest. A typical measurement might be written as 66.4 ± 0.2 ml.

                        Greenhouse gases are essential for maintaining Earth's habitable temperature through the greenhouse effect, but increased concentrations due to human activities are driving climate change. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but its concentration is controlled by temperature rather than direct emissions. Carbon dioxide is the most important anthropogenic (man-made) greenhouse gas, accounting for about 76% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Methane is much more potent than CO₂ but has a shorter atmospheric lifetime. The greenhouse effect works because these gases are transparent to incoming higher frequency (visible) solar radiation but absorb outgoing lower frequency (infrared) radiation, thereby trapping heat in the atmosphere. Understanding greenhouse gases is fundamental to climate science and atmospheric physics.
