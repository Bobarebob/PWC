                        Analog devices differ from digital devices in that they use continuous scales rather than discrete digital displays. Examples include micrometer calipers, metric metal rulers, beam balance scales, and graduated cylinders. For analog devices, the tolerance or instrument limiting error is typically determined using the "one-half rule" - taking the tolerance to be half of the least count, because we can conservatively say we can "see" 2 parts in the least count.

                    <h2>Astrobiology</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The scientific study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe, including life on Earth and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

                        Astrobiology combines aspects of astronomy, biology, and geology to understand how life might arise and evolve in different environments. NASA's astrobiology program addresses three fundamental questions: How does life begin and evolve? Does life exist elsewhere in the Universe? What is the future of life on Earth and beyond? This interdisciplinary field emerged in the 1990s and has become central to space exploration missions, including the search for biosignatures on Mars and the study of potentially habitable exoplanets.

                    <h2>Astrology</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A belief system that attempts to predict human affairs and terrestrial events based on the positions and movements of celestial bodies.

                        Traditional astrology claims there are 12 zodiacal constellations, but the Sun actually passes through 13 constellations, including Ophiuchus between Scorpius and Sagittarius. Due to the precession of Earth's axis over 26,000 years, the Sun on your birthday is not in the astrological sign traditionally assigned to that date - it's off by about a month. For example, if traditional astrology says your Sun sign is Virgo (August 23-September 22), the Sun is actually in Virgo between September 16-October 30. While astrology has historical and cultural significance, it is not considered a science as its claims cannot be tested through the scientific method.
