                    <h2>Absorption</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The process by which light energy is converted to other forms of energy when electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, resulting in the reduction of light intensity.

                    <div class="context">
                        When light encounters matter, it can be absorbed by atoms and molecules, causing electrons to move to higher energy levels or causing molecular vibrations and rotations. The absorbed energy is typically converted to thermal energy (heat), though it can also drive chemical reactions or be re-emitted at different wavelengths. Different materials absorb different wavelengths selectively, which is why objects appear colored - they absorb certain wavelengths while reflecting others. Absorption is fundamental to many processes including photosynthesis, solar energy conversion, and the greenhouse effect. The amount of absorption depends on the material's properties, the wavelength of light, and the thickness of the material, following the Beer-Lambert law in many cases.

                        Accuracy is often confused with precision, but they represent different aspects of measurement quality. While accuracy measures how close you are to the true value, precision measures how close repeated measurements are to each other. A measurement can be precise but not accurate (consistently wrong), accurate but not precise (correct on average but scattered), or both accurate and precise (the ideal case). For example, if the true length of an object is 10.0 cm, measurements of 9.9, 10.0, and 10.1 cm would be accurate, while measurements of 8.1, 8.2, and 8.1 cm would be precise but not accurate.

                    <div class="context">
                        Airglow is a continuous, weak luminescence of the sky that occurs both day and night, though it's most visible during nighttime observations. It results from several processes including chemiluminescence (chemical reactions producing light), fluorescence (absorption and re-emission of solar radiation), and recombination of atoms and molecules that were dissociated by solar ultraviolet radiation during the day. The phenomenon creates different colored emissions at various altitudes - green oxygen emissions around 100 km, red oxygen emissions around 300 km, and sodium emissions around 90 km. Airglow can interfere with astronomical observations but also provides valuable information about atmospheric composition and dynamics.

                        The fraction of solar radiation reflected by a surface, expressed as a ratio between 0 (perfect absorption) and 1 (perfect reflection), or as a percentage.

                        Albedo is a crucial factor in Earth's energy balance and climate system. Fresh snow has a high albedo (0.8-0.9), reflecting most incoming solar radiation, while dark ocean water has a low albedo (0.06), absorbing most solar energy. This creates important feedback loops in climate change - as ice melts due to warming, it exposes darker surfaces that absorb more heat, leading to further warming. Different surfaces have characteristic albedos: forests (0.15), grasslands (0.25), deserts (0.4), and clouds (0.5-0.9). Understanding albedo is essential for climate modeling and studying planetary energy budgets.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A fundamental law of electromagnetism that relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop, forming one of Maxwell's four equations.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field around a current-carrying conductor is proportional to the current and inversely related to the distance from the conductor. This law is essential for understanding how electric currents create magnetic fields and how changing magnetic fields can induce electric fields. In Maxwell's formulation, Ampere's Law was modified to include the displacement current term, which was crucial for predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves. The law explains how oscillating electric fields create oscillating magnetic fields, which in turn create oscillating electric fields, allowing electromagnetic waves (light) to propagate through space as self-sustaining disturbances. This principle is fundamental to understanding radio transmission, light propagation, and all electromagnetic phenomena.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A region in the upper atmosphere where sound waves cannot propagate effectively due to extremely low air density, typically beginning around 160 kilometers altitude.

                    <div class="context">
                        The anacoustic zone exists because sound requires a medium to travel through, and at altitude of about 160 km, the atmosphere becomes so thin that there are insufficient air molecules to carry sound waves effectively. This zone begins in the lower thermosphere where the mean free path of molecules becomes comparable to or larger than the wavelength of sound. While electromagnetic radiation (like radio waves) can still propagate through this region, acoustic waves cannot. This has important implications for atmospheric studies and explains why sounds from space cannot be heard on Earth without electronic amplification and conversion.

                        Argon is a chemically inert noble gas that plays an important role in atmospheric science and various industrial applications. It was the first noble gas to be discovered on Earth (1894) and gets its name from the Greek word "argos" meaning "lazy" due to its chemical inactivity. In the atmosphere, argon is produced by the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in Earth's crust and has accumulated over geological time. Its concentration remains relatively constant because it doesn't react with other atmospheric components. Argon is used in welding, lighting, and as a protective atmosphere for growing silicon crystals. Its presence in the atmosphere is also used in radiometric dating techniques.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A belief system that attempts to predict human affairs and terrestrial events based on the positions and movements of celestial bodies.

                        Traditional astrology claims there are 12 zodiacal constellations, but the Sun actually passes through 13 constellations, including Ophiuchus between Scorpius and Sagittarius. Due to the precession of Earth's axis over 26,000 years, the Sun on your birthday is not in the astrological sign traditionally assigned to that date - it's off by about a month. For example, if traditional astrology says your Sun sign is Virgo (August 23-September 22), the Sun is actually in Virgo between September 16-October 30. While astrology has historical and cultural significance, it is not considered a science as its claims cannot be tested through the scientific method.

                    <h2>Astronomical Unit (AU)</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A unit of length defined to be exactly equal to 149,597,870.7 kilometers (92,955,807.3 miles), approximately the average distance between Earth and the Sun.

                    <div class="context">
                        The astronomical unit serves as a fundamental measurement for distances within our solar system and provides a convenient scale for expressing planetary distances. For example, Mars orbits at about 1.5 AU from the Sun, while Jupiter is approximately 5.2 AU away. The AU is also used in defining other astronomical distance units - one parsec equals about 206,265 AU. Originally conceived as the semi-major axis of Earth's orbit, the AU was redefined in 2012 by the International Astronomical Union as an exact value to provide a stable reference for astronomical measurements.

                    <h2>Aurorae</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Spectacular light displays in the upper atmosphere caused by the interaction of charged particles from the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field and atmospheric gases.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Aurorae, commonly known as the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) and Southern Lights (Aurora Australis), occur when solar wind particles are channeled by Earth's magnetic field toward the polar regions. These charged particles collide with atmospheric gases at altitudes of 80-300 km, exciting oxygen and nitrogen atoms that then emit light. Oxygen produces green and red (or combined, yellow) colors, while nitrogen creates blue, magenta and purple hues. The oval-shaped auroral zones typically occur around 65-70 degrees magnetic latitude, but during strong geomagnetic storms, aurorae can be visible at much lower latitudes. Similar phenomena occur on other planets with magnetic fields, including Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars.

                    <h2>Axial Tilt</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The angle between a planet's rotational axis and the perpendicular to its orbital plane, which determines the planet's seasons and climate patterns.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Earth's axial tilt of approximately 23.5 degrees is responsible for our seasonal changes as different hemispheres receive varying amounts of direct sunlight throughout the year. During summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole tilts toward the Sun, resulting in longer days and more direct sunlight. Mars has a similar axial tilt to Earth (about 25 degrees), giving it comparable seasonal patterns, though its seasons last about twice as long due to its longer orbital period. Venus has an extreme axial tilt of about 177 degrees, meaning it rotates nearly upside down, while Uranus has an axial tilt of 98 degrees, essentially rotating on its side.
