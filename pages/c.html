                        The second-largest moon of Jupiter and the third-largest moon in the Solar System, believed to harbor a subsurface liquid ocean beneath its icy crust.

                        Callisto is considered one of the most promising targets for astrobiology research due to its subsurface ocean, which may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. The moon's relatively stable environment and distance from Jupiter's intense radiation make it an attractive target for future exploration missions. Unlike Europa, Callisto's ocean is likely separated from its rocky core by a layer of ice, but it still represents a potentially habitable environment.

During this period, organisms developed hard shells, complex eyes, and sophisticated body plans that form the basis of modern animal diversity.

This interval represents a range where we can assign a probability - like 67% or 100% - that the confidence interval "captures" the true value of the measurement. All scientific measurements are fundamentally probability statements, acknowledging that no measurement can be written with absolute certainty.

The beauty of conserved quantities is that they provide additional equations to help solve for unknown physical values. According to Noether's theorem, for every symmetry seen in nature, there is a corresponding conserved physical quantity.

The CMB provides crucial evidence for the Big Bang theory and allows scientists to study the early universe's conditions and composition with extraordinary precision.

                        Einstein initially added the cosmological constant (Λ) to his equations to prevent the universe from expanding or contracting. After Hubble's discovery of cosmic expansion, Einstein called it his "greatest mistake." However, the discovery of accelerating expansion has revived interest in this concept. The cosmological constant is now the leading explanation for dark energy, the mysterious force driving the universe's accelerating expansion.

                        As the universe expands, the space between galaxies stretches, and light traveling through this space gets stretched as well. This is different from Doppler redshift, which is caused by motion through space rather than the expansion of space itself. Cosmological redshift is a key tool for measuring distances to far galaxies and studying the expansion history of the universe.
