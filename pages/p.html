                        The hypothesis that life exists throughout the universe and is distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, comets, and planetoids, potentially seeding life on Earth from space.

                        While not widely accepted by the scientific community, panspermia offers an alternative explanation for the origin of life on Earth. The discovery of extremophiles that can survive in space-like conditions has lent some credibility to the possibility of life traveling between worlds. Some scientists propose that life could spread throughout the galaxy via natural processes or even deliberate seeding by advanced civilizations.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The apparent displacement of an object caused by a change in observational position, which can introduce measurement errors if not properly accounted for.

                    <div class="context">
                        In scientific measurements, parallax error occurs when you don't view the measurement scale straight on. For example, when reading a graduated cylinder, you must view the water level at water level height to avoid parallax error. If you look from above or below, the apparent position of the meniscus will shift, leading to inaccurate readings. Proper measurement technique requires eliminating parallax by positioning your eye or eyes at the same level or position as the measurement being taken.

                        A unit of length used to measure astronomical distances, defined as the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond, equal to approximately 3.26 light-years.

                    <div class="context">
                        The parsec (symbol: pc) is the preferred unit for measuring distances to stars and galaxies in professional astronomy. It is derived from stellar parallax measurements - if a star shows a parallax of one arcsecond when observed from opposite sides of Earth's orbit, it is exactly one parsec away. One parsec equals about 206,265 astronomical units or 30.9 trillion kilometers. Larger distances are often expressed in kiloparsecs (kpc) for galactic scales or megaparsecs (Mpc) for intergalactic distances. The parsec provides a direct connection between observable parallax angles and actual distances.

                        While working at Bell Telephone Labs on a microwave antenna for telecommunications, Penzias and Wilson detected persistent background "noise" that they couldn't explain. This turned out to be the cosmic microwave background radiation - the afterglow of the Big Bang itself. This discovery provided the first direct observational evidence for the Big Bang theory and earned Penzias and Wilson the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics.

                        Due to precession, the Sun on your birthday is not in the astrological sign traditionally assigned to that date - it's off by about a month. For example, if traditional astrology says your Sun sign is Virgo (August 23-September 22), the Sun is actually in Virgo between September 16-October 30. This is one of the problems with traditional astrology, as the zodiacal positions have shifted significantly over the thousands of years since astrological systems were established.

                        Precision is often confused with accuracy, but they measure different aspects of measurement quality. Precision refers to how close repeated measurements are to each other, while accuracy refers to how close measurements are to the true value. High precision means measurements are consistent, reproducible and close to each other, even if they might all be systematically off from the true value. For example, if you measure the same object multiple times and get 8.1, 8.2, and 8.1 cm, your measurements are precise (consistent) but may not be accurate if the true value is 10.0 cm. The best measurements are both precise and accurate.

Anyone can make a conjecture about the objective world, but if the statement can never be tested by experiment, it is not scientific and cannot be part of the scientific canon. The Principle of Falsifiability is particularly important today because individuals sometimes make statements they claim are scientific, but are in fact untestable. If a conjecture cannot be shown to be false through experimentation, it falls outside the realm of science.
