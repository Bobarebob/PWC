                    <h2>MACHOs</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects - a proposed form of dark matter consisting of ordinary matter that is simply too dim to detect directly, such as brown dwarfs, black holes, or rogue planets.

                    <div class="context">
                        MACHOs represent one of two main candidates for dark matter (the other being WIMPs). These objects would be composed of baryonic matter but would be difficult to observe because they emit little or no light. While some MACHOs certainly exist, observations suggest they cannot account for all of the dark matter in the universe, leading to greater focus on exotic particle candidates like WIMPs.

                        Microwave radiation is crucial in astronomy, particularly the cosmic microwave background (CMB) which is the afterglow of the Big Bang. This radiation provides a snapshot of the universe when it was only 380,000 years old and has been redshifted from visible light to microwave frequencies due to cosmic expansion.

                        The galaxy containing our Solar System, a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated 100-400 billion stars and a diameter of about 100,000 light-years.

                        The Milky Way is the focus of most SETI searches and astrobiology research, as it represents our local galactic environment. Understanding the structure and composition of our galaxy is crucial for estimating the potential number of habitable worlds and the likelihood of extraterrestrial civilizations. Recent studies suggest there could be billions of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy alone.

                    <div class="definition">
                        The hypothetical concept that our universe is just one of many universes, possibly infinite in number, each with potentially different physical laws and constants.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The multiverse concept arose from attempts to explain why the fundamental constants of our universe appear to be fine-tuned for life. If infinite universes exist with different constants, we naturally find ourselves in one suitable for life. While the multiverse remains highly speculative and untestable, it offers a potential explanation for the apparent fine-tuning of physical constants without requiring divine intervention or special design.
