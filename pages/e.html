                    <div class="definition">
                        The sixth-largest moon of Saturn, known for its subsurface ocean and active geysers that eject water vapor and organic compounds into space.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Enceladus is considered one of the most promising places in our solar system to search for life. The Cassini spacecraft discovered that the moon's south polar region has active geysers containing water, salts, and organic molecules, suggesting a warm, potentially habitable ocean beneath its icy surface. The tidal heating from Saturn keeps this ocean liquid.

                        A biological process where one organism lives inside another, eventually leading to the evolution of complex eukaryotic cells through the incorporation of bacterial cells as organelles.

                        Endosymbiosis is believed to be responsible for the evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells, representing a crucial step in the development of complex life on Earth. This process is considered one of the unlikely events cited in the Rare Earth Hypothesis, as it required precise conditions and timing.

                        The ability to sense and maintain our balance relative to the force of gravity, one of the 16 or so additional senses humans have beyond the five common senses.

                    <div class="context">
                        Equilibrioception is an example of how we learn about the external world through sensory data, as described by Aristotle's principle that "knowledge is the product of experience." This sense works in conjunction with the vestibular system in our inner ear to help us maintain balance and spatial orientation. While we commonly think of only five senses (seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, tasting), humans actually have many more senses including equilibrioception, as well as senses of itching, hunger, and relative humidity.

                        The fourth-largest moon of Jupiter and one of the Galilean moons, believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust that may contain twice as much water as Earth's oceans.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Europa is a prime target for astrobiology research due to its subsurface ocean, which is kept liquid by tidal heating from Jupiter's gravitational pull. Future missions like NASA's Europa Clipper aim to study this moon's potential for harboring life. The ocean likely has direct contact with the rocky seafloor, potentially creating hydrothermal vents.

                        Experiments are the foundation of the scientific method and must be designed to test specific hypotheses through controlled conditions. A well-designed experiment isolates variables to determine cause-and-effect relationships. The results must be reproducible by other scientists to be considered valid. Experiments can be observational (like astronomical observations) or controlled laboratory studies, but all must follow rigorous protocols to ensure reliable results.

                        The study of extremophiles has expanded our understanding of the limits of life and the potential for life to exist in harsh environments on other planets. Examples include organisms found near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, in highly acidic environments, and in extremely cold or radioactive conditions. They suggest life could exist in previously unimaginable environments.
