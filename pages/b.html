                        Baryonic matter represents only about 4.6% of the total universe. The term "baryonic" comes from baryons, a class of particles that includes protons and neutrons. This is the matter we can see and interact with directly. Despite being the foundation of all visible structures in the universe, baryonic matter is vastly outnumbered by dark matter and dark energy, highlighting how little we understand about the universe's true composition.

                        Beam balance scales are less precise than micrometers, so they typically use the 100% rule for determining tolerance - meaning the tolerance equals the least count. For a typical beam balance scale with a least count of 0.1 grams, the tolerance is also 0.1 gram, so a measurement might be written as 45.3 ± 0.1 grams. These scales work by comparing the mass of an unknown object to known standard masses.

When making many identical measurements (on the order of 100 measurements), statistics may allow us to produce a better best guess, typically the arithmetic average of all measurements. The best guess is always accompanied by a tolerance and unit to form a complete scientific measurement.

                        Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) is one of the most recognizable stars in the night sky, forming part of the distinctive pattern of Orion. As a red supergiant, it is one of the largest known stars, with a radius hundreds of times that of the Sun. The star is semi-regular variable, meaning its brightness changes over time. Its name derives from the Arabic phrase meaning "shoulder of Orion." Betelgeuse is relatively young astronomically but is nearing the end of its stellar evolution and may explode as a supernova within the next 100,000 years.

Evidence includes the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of light elements, and the observed expansion of the universe. The theory was first proposed by Georges Lemaître and later developed by many scientists.

This scenario, also called the "Heat Death" of the universe, is estimated to occur in about 100 trillion years - more than 7,000 times longer than the current age of the universe.

                        Before the discovery of dark energy and accelerating expansion, some cosmologists theorized that if the universe contained enough matter, gravity would eventually overcome expansion and cause a contraction phase. The discovery of dark energy in 1998 made the Big Crunch scenario highly unlikely, as the accelerating expansion appears to be permanent.

They were first observed from aircraft in 1989 and are now studied using high-speed cameras and space-based observations. Unlike lightning that travels downward or horizontally, blue jets propagate upward at speeds of about 100 km/s. They appear blue due to the emission of nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere. Blue jets are part of a family of upper atmospheric phenomena that includes red sprites, elves, and gigantic jets, all of which help scientists understand the electrical coupling between the troposphere and upper atmosphere.
