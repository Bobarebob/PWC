                    <h2>Callisto</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The second-largest moon of Jupiter and the third-largest moon in the Solar System, believed to harbor a subsurface liquid ocean beneath its icy crust.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Callisto is considered one of the most promising targets for astrobiology research due to its subsurface ocean, which may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. The moon's relatively stable environment and distance from Jupiter's intense radiation make it an attractive target for future exploration missions. Unlike Europa, Callisto's ocean is likely separated from its rocky core by a layer of ice, but it still represents a potentially habitable environment.

                    <h2>Cambrian Explosion</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A period of rapid evolutionary diversification that occurred approximately 541 million years ago, during which most major animal phyla appeared in the fossil record.

                    <div class="context">
                        The Cambrian Explosion represents one of the most significant events in Earth's biological history and is considered crucial to the development of complex life. This event is often cited in discussions of the Rare Earth Hypothesis as an example of the unlikely circumstances that led to complex life on Earth. During this period, organisms developed hard shells, complex eyes, and sophisticated body plans that form the basis of modern animal diversity.

                    <h2>Cosmic Pluralism</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The philosophical and scientific idea that there are many worlds throughout the universe that could harbor life similar to Earth.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        This concept dates back to ancient times and was notably advocated by Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. Modern cosmic pluralism is supported by the discovery of thousands of exoplanets and the understanding that the conditions for life may be more common than previously thought. The principle suggests that Earth is not unique and that life should be abundant throughout the cosmos.

                        Curiosity has made groundbreaking discoveries including evidence of ancient riverbeds, seasonal variations in methane levels, and organic compounds in Martian rocks. These findings have significantly advanced our understanding of Mars' potential for past or present life. The rover's sophisticated instruments continue to analyze the Martian environment, searching for conditions that could have supported microbial life.
