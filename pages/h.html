                    <h2>Hawking Radiation</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Theoretical radiation predicted to be emitted by black holes due to quantum effects near the event horizon, causing black holes to slowly evaporate over time.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974, this radiation arises from quantum fluctuations in the vacuum near a black hole's event horizon. Virtual particle pairs are created, with one particle falling into the black hole while the other escapes as radiation. Hawking radiation suggests that black holes are not completely black and will eventually evaporate completely, playing a crucial role in the universe's ultimate fate during the Big Chill scenario.

                    <h2>Edwin Hubble</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        American astronomer who discovered that the universe is expanding and established the relationship between galaxy distance and recession velocity, now known as Hubble's Law.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        In the 1920s, Hubble used the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory to measure distances to galaxies and their redshifts. He found that more distant galaxies are receding faster, providing the first observational evidence for cosmic expansion. Hubble's discoveries revolutionized cosmology, providing evidence for the Big Bang theory and establishing the field of extragalactic astronomy. The Hubble Space Telescope is named in his honor.
