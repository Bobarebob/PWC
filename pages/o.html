                    <h2>Occam's Principle</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        An advisory principle stating that whenever there are two competing hypotheses, chances are the simpler of the two is the correct one.

                    <div class="context">
                        Occam's Principle never claims that the simpler of two competing hypotheses is always the correct one, only that the simpler hypothesis is likely to be the correct one. Both hypotheses could be wrong, or the less simple hypothesis could be correct. However, if you are looking for guidance on which hypothesis to explore in depth first, Occam suggests examining the simpler one first. This principle was demonstrated in the comparison between the geocentric and heliocentric models of the solar system, where the much simpler heliocentric model proved to be correct.

                    <h2>One-half Rule</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A method for determining tolerance in analog measuring devices by taking the tolerance to be half of the least count.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        For analog devices, we use the one-half rule because we can conservatively say that we can "see" 2 parts in the least count. This means we can determine with 100% confidence that the center line of the sleeve is either exactly on a marking on the thimble, or somewhere between two adjacent markings. By adding and subtracting half the least count, we create a least count-sized "window" around our best guess. For example, a micrometer measurement would be written as 15.500 Â± 0.005 mm.
