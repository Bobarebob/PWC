                    <div class="definition">
                        The internationally recognized boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space, located at an altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles) above sea level.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Named after aerospace engineer Theodore von Kármán, this boundary represents the altitude where the atmosphere becomes so thin that conventional aircraft cannot generate enough lift to maintain flight. Above the Kármán line, spacecraft must rely on orbital velocity rather than aerodynamic lift to stay aloft. This altitude is used by international aviation and space organizations to define the beginning of space for legal and regulatory purposes. The Kármán line lies within the thermosphere, where atmospheric density is extremely low but still sufficient to cause orbital decay for satellites over time. Different organizations use slightly different definitions for the beginning of outer space - NASA uses 80 km (50 miles) for astronaut wings (NASA employees only), while the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale uses the 100 km standard.

                    <div class="definition">
                        German astronomer and mathematician (1571-1630) who discovered the three fundamental laws of planetary motion, revolutionizing our understanding of the solar system.

                    <div class="context">
                        Kepler's three laws of planetary motion provided the mathematical foundation for understanding how planets orbit the Sun. His first law established that planetary orbits are elliptical rather than circular, his second law described how planets move faster when closer to the Sun, and his third law related orbital periods to distances from the Sun. These discoveries were crucial for Newton's later development of the law of universal gravitation and represent one of the greatest achievements in the history of astronomy and physics.

                    <h2>Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Three fundamental laws discovered by Johannes Kepler that describe the motion of planets around the Sun: elliptical orbits, equal areas in equal times, and the relationship between orbital period and distance.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Kepler's First Law states that planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths with the Sun at one focus. The Second Law (Law of Equal Areas) describes that a line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals, meaning planets move faster when closer to the Sun. The Third Law establishes that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the Sun. These laws, published between 1609 and 1619, replaced the ancient belief in circular orbits and provided the mathematical framework that enabled Newton to formulate his law of universal gravitation. Kepler's laws apply not only to planets but to all objects in gravitational orbits, including moons, asteroids, and artificial satellites, making them fundamental to modern astronomy and space exploration.

                        A NASA space telescope mission (2009-2018) designed to discover Earth-sized exoplanets in the habitable zones of their stars using the transit method.

                        The Kepler mission revolutionized exoplanet science by discovering over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets and thousands of candidates. Its data suggests that Earth-sized planets in habitable zones may be common throughout the galaxy, supporting the possibility of widespread life. The mission used the transit method, detecting the slight dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them.

                        The law stating that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the Sun, mathematically expressed as T² ∝ a³.

                    <div class="context">
                        Kepler's Third Law reveals the fundamental relationship between orbital distance and orbital period for all objects orbiting the Sun. This law allows astronomers to calculate orbital periods if they know distances, or vice versa. For example, Mars orbits at 1.5 AU from the Sun, so its orbital period should be (1.5)^(3/2) = 1.84 Earth years, which matches observations. This law was later explained by Newton's law of universal gravitation and applies to any system of orbiting bodies, from moons around planets to planets around stars.

                        A mass extinction event that occurred approximately 66 million years ago, marking the end of the Cretaceous period and the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.

                    <div class="context">
                        Also known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, this catastrophe was likely caused by an asteroid impact combined with volcanic activity. The extinction of dinosaurs allowed mammals to diversify and eventually led to the evolution of humans, making it a crucial event in Earth's history and the Rare Earth Hypothesis. Without this event, intelligent life might never have evolved on Earth.
