                    <h2>Water Vapor</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The gaseous form of water present in the atmosphere, representing the most important greenhouse gas and playing a crucial role in weather patterns, climate regulation, and the water cycle.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        Water vapor is invisible to the human eye and makes up 0-4% of the atmosphere by volume, varying greatly with location, temperature, and weather conditions. It's the most abundant and important greenhouse gas, responsible for about 60% of the natural greenhouse effect that keeps Earth warm enough for life. Water vapor creates a positive feedback loop in climate systems - as temperatures rise, more water evaporates, increasing atmospheric water vapor, which traps more heat and causes further warming. Water vapor condenses to form clouds and precipitation when air becomes saturated, driving weather systems and the global water cycle. It's measured as absolute humidity (actual amount of water vapor) or relative humidity (percentage of maximum possible water vapor at that temperature). Understanding water vapor distribution and behavior is crucial for weather forecasting, climate modeling, and atmospheric science.

                    <div class="definition">
                        American radio astronomer who, along with Arno Penzias, accidentally discovered the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 while working at Bell Telephone Labs.

                    <div class="context">
                        Wilson and Penzias were trying to eliminate background noise from a microwave antenna when they discovered the persistent 2.7 Kelvin radiation coming from all directions in space. This turned out to be the afterglow of the Big Bang. This accidental discovery provided the first direct evidence for the Big Bang theory and earned Wilson and Penzias the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics.

                    <div class="definition">
                        Weakly Interacting Massive Particles - hypothetical elementary particles that are a leading candidate for dark matter, interacting only through gravity and the weak nuclear force.

                    <div class="context">
                        WIMPs are predicted by supersymmetry theories and would have masses similar to heavy atomic nuclei but interact so weakly with ordinary matter that they're extremely difficult to detect. Many underground experiments are searching for WIMP interactions. If WIMPs exist, they could explain the nature of dark matter and provide a bridge between particle physics and cosmology, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of fundamental physics.

                    <h2>Winter Solstice</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The astronomical event when the Sun reaches its lowest position in the sky, resulting in the shortest day and longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The Winter Solstice occurs around December 21-22 each year when the Sun is directly overhead at the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5Â° South latitude). This marks the official beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere. During the winter solstice, the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun at its maximum angle, resulting in the fewest daylight hours for locations north of the equator. The word "solstice" comes from Latin meaning "sun stands still," referring to the apparent pause in the Sun's southward movement in the sky before it begins moving north again.

                        A prominent asterism formed by three of the brightest stars in the winter sky: Sirius, Betelgeuse, and Procyon, creating an imaginary isosceles triangle.

                    <div class="context">
                        The Winter Triangle is one of the most recognizable star patterns in the northern winter sky. Sirius (in Canis Major) is the brightest star in the night sky, Betelgeuse (in Orion) is a red supergiant, and Procyon (in Canis Minor) is the eighth-brightest star. This asterism spans multiple constellations and serves as an excellent guide for winter stargazing. The triangle is nearly equilateral and dominates the southern sky during winter evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, making it an ideal starting point for identifying other winter constellations.

                        WMAP measured tiny temperature variations in the CMB across the entire sky, providing crucial data about the early universe's conditions and the seeds that grew into today's cosmic structures. WMAP's measurements established the standard model of cosmology, determining that the universe is 13.772 billion years old and consists of specific percentages of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy.

                        A strong narrowband radio signal detected by the Big Ear radio telescope at Ohio State University on August 15, 1977, that lasted 72 seconds and has never been detected again.

                    <div class="context">
                        The signal was so remarkable that astronomer Jerry Ehman wrote 'Wow!' on the computer printout, giving the signal its name. Despite numerous attempts to detect it again, the signal remains unexplained and is considered one of the most intriguing potential SETI detections in history. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and had characteristics consistent with an extraterrestrial origin.
