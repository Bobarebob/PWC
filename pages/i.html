                    <h2>Inductive Reasoning</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A type of thinking where while we cannot say with 100% certainty that the next time you let go of a pen it will fall straight down, you would not bet your life that it won't happen, even for a million dollars.

                    <div class="context">
                        Inductive reasoning allows scientists to conclude with virtual certainty that a hypothesis tested is true or false based on the consistency of experimental results. It is the consistency of experimental results that allows scientists to conclude that the hypothesis tested is true. This type of reasoning is fundamental to the scientific method - while we cannot achieve absolute certainty, the repeatability and consistency of experimental outcomes provide the foundation for scientific knowledge and physical laws.

                    <h2>International Space Station</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A large spacecraft orbiting Earth at an altitude of approximately 400 kilometers (250 miles), serving as a laboratory for scientific research and international cooperation in space exploration.

                        The International Space Station (ISS) is one of humanity's greatest achievements in space exploration and international cooperation. Launched in 1998, it orbits Earth every 90 minutes at a speed of about 28,000 km/h (17,500 mph). The ISS operates within the ionosphere and thermosphere, where the extremely thin atmosphere still creates enough drag to gradually slow the station, requiring periodic boosts to maintain its orbit. The station serves as a unique laboratory for studying the effects of microgravity on biological systems, materials science, and atmospheric phenomena. Astronauts aboard the ISS conduct experiments that cannot be performed on Earth and provide valuable insights into atmospheric science, including studies of lightning, aurorae, and atmospheric chemistry. The ISS also serves as a testbed for technologies needed for future deep space missions.

                    <h2>Inverse Square Law</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A physical law stating that the intensity of a physical quantity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that quantity.
                    </div>
                    <div class="context">
                        The inverse square law applies to many fundamental forces and phenomena in physics, including gravitational force, electromagnetic radiation, and sound intensity. For example, if you double the distance from a light source, the brightness decreases by a factor of four (2²). This law is crucial in astronomy for understanding stellar brightness, in physics for calculating gravitational and electromagnetic forces, and in many practical applications from photography to radiation safety. The mathematical relationship is expressed as I ∝ 1/r², where I is intensity and r is distance.

                    <div class="definition">
                        A region of Earth's upper atmosphere, extending from about 60 to 1000 kilometers altitude, characterized by a high concentration of ions and free electrons created by solar radiation.

                    <div class="context">
                        The ionosphere plays a crucial role in radio communications, as it can reflect radio waves back to Earth, enabling long-distance communication. It consists of several layers (D, E, F1, and F2) that vary in density and altitude depending on solar activity and time of day. During periods of high solar activity, the ionosphere becomes more ionized, which can enhance radio propagation but also cause disruptions to satellite communications and GPS systems. The ionosphere is also where auroras occur, as charged particles from the solar wind interact with atmospheric gases. Understanding the ionosphere is essential for space weather prediction and maintaining reliable communication systems.
